I lived on Andersen, the air force base on the northern part of the island. My favorite places I visited were Two Lovers Point, Tarzan Falls, Mt. Lamlam, and Tweed&apos;s Cave. The beaches were so beautiful and the local Chamorro culture was also interesting.  I would love to go back some day and revisit the sites of my childhood someday.",20

From Tucson it is about an hour's drive and twenty minutes from Nogales. Tubac is an unspoiled town with great hiking, birding, mountain biking and an incredible golf course. It depends on tourism and is a little on the expensive side if you ask me, but a great place to visit if you find yourself in these parts.",86

0,1,"The Chesterfield Islands are a remote island group nearly halfway between New Caledonia and Australia.  For a few years, I searched for a way to cross between the two, in order to visit Mellish Reef and Chesterfields on the same run but it was too expensive and logistically challenging, due to distance, fuel, and customs requirements.  Finally, I agreed to charter a sportfishing boat, the Quo Vadis, through Pacific Charters in Noumea.<br><br>Quo Vadis is skippered by Olivier Quach, an interesting and accomplished Caledonian of Vietnamese descent.  Direct booking can be made through their family business Powercat Charter (www.powercat-charter.com).  Olivier's brother Gerald is a bodybuilder who was previously ""Mister New Caledonia"", and his friend Michel was a Pacific spearfishing champion.<br><br>We departed Koumac on the northern tip of the mainland the night of 11 December, 2004, and were among the Chesterfields 36 hours later.  Along the way we caught a swordfish, mahi mahi, and a parrotfish, as well as lobster in the lagoon (there was one other fishing boat in the lagoon while we were there).<br><br>We landed on Ile du Loop - the southernmost of the Chesterfields, which we knew to have a marker suitable for a photo, but just in case, the Quach brothers had created a handmade sign reading ""Welcome to Chesterfields"".  Ile du Loop was absolutely covered with red-footed boobys, and it was here that I realized the derivation of ""booby-trap"".  Boobies dig nests in the sandy scrub, then camouflage the holes with brush, creating a dangerous zone for walking, with the potential for broken legs at every step!<br><br>After a fabulous sashimi and lobster dinner, we set out for Noumea at sunset, arriving 36 hours later to catch high tide through the passage into Koumac.  A highlight of the subsequent week in Noumea was dinner at Chez Quach 3 nights later.  Many Vietnamese spring rolls and much American whiskey was consumed that night to celebrate our successful Chesterfields expedition.",8
1,1,"Annobon has an airport (a runway, anyway). There is a flight from Malabo (SSG) most Saturdays on the airline GEASA, although this is unpredictable. On the Friday I investigated this, no one at the Malabo airport knew anything about flights to Annobon, yet the next morning, check-in was happening, with a cardboard sign for Annobon taped above the counter. Domestic airline executives and pilots in Equatorial Guinea are nearly all Kazakh Russians, and the executive in charge at GEASA is Misha, whose cellphone is local number 203 283. This seems to be the only way to get good flight information or reserve a ticket. The price is negotiable - cash only, of course - because there are no seats on the Antonov aircraft. Passengers climb in the cargo hold from the rear and sit on boxes or on the floor... Prior to flying, one must obtain a permit from the Department of the Interior in Malabo. Without this permit, a foreigner will be detained by police at the Annobon airstrip and asked to return on the same aircraft.",357
2,1,"My friend Misha and I drove in a rented Land Rover from Moscow to Vladivostok in 2007, with many twists and turns along the way.  The road from Abakan to Kyzyl, the capital of Tuva, was surprisingly good, and we enjoyed the spectacular overlooks of mountains, fields, and forests.  However, based on the map, we misjudged the size of a prospective ""town"" near the border, and shuddered to a stop right at the border marker to Tuva, completely out of fuel.  Fortunately, some berry-pickers selling their wares by the roadside allowed us to siphon some of their petrol - enough to make it to Kyzyl.  We had beaten up our car enough not to care that the petrol from their old Lada was 80 octane, when ours was supposed to be 95 octane!",558
3,1,"On August 6, ten people left Apia, Samoa on a one-off expedition on the R/V Bounty Bay. There were 3 Fijian crew, 3 scientists (including Jim Maragos, a leading coral reef specialist and manager for the US Fish and Wildlife Service), and 4 paying passengers/tourists (including myself). This was one of the few voyages ever to bring civilians to Baker and Howland Islands.</p><p>The Bounty Bay was an slow and uncomfortable catamaran, with bunks along the wall in each pontoon. There was very little airflow below, which made for many miserable hours onboard.</p><p>We reached Baker Island after 15 days at sea, and made a beach landing from an inflatable zodiac. Because there had been substantial US Military activity there in WWII, the reef was blasted away in a couple of spots, so landing and departing was relatively easy (especially compared to Howland). The island was more or less oval-shaped, with a 20m crushed coral beach rising about 5 meters to a grassy interior filled with birds. The runway had crossed the island on a east-west orientation, but the entire interior of the island was overgrown, making the exact runway location difficult to assess (especially since we were asked not to walk on the interior). However, six radio towers remained standing at what looked to be the east (windward) end of the runway.</p><p>Three of the passengers walked around the perimeter of Baker, finding hermit crabs, spiders, birds, and a the odd lizard or two, as well as the ruins of two American landing craft. The day beacon which stood approximately 20 feet tall was filled with hermit crabs, as was nearly any other shady spot on the island!</p><p>Howland Island is less than 40 miles from Baker, but differs in several ways: First, it is long and thin, and oriented north-south, so is suitable only for a very short runway, as the prevailing trade winds are east-west. Although a runway was prepared on Howland for Amelia Earhart's arrival, there is no evidence of its location, and it is very difficult to understand why Howland would have been chosen over Baker as a suitable landing spot for an airplane. In fact, no airplane has ever landed on Howland Island, although an American seaplane crashed near the island long ago and sits in pieces on the shore.</p><p>Secondly, Howland was never settled extensively, so retains its full surrounding reef, and accompanying surf break. Whereas landing over the reef on the leeward side in the direction of the surf is normally possible, departing through the break is very difficult, even at high tide. Our party had significant problems navigating an inflatable zodiac through the break, because of the strength of the break, and the sharp, irregular coral. Three strong men were whipped around like rag dolls, our legs scraped and cut, and I was at point forced under the boat. This because two people in the party could not swim, and had to be transported by boat. It would have been much easier, although dangerous in itself, to swim through the break.</p><p>Because of the difficulties in that departure, a decision was made to postpone further rescues until high tide. Therefore two of the landing party were stranded on the island for 9 hours, resulting in extensive sunburn.</p><p>As for nature on the island, birdlife on Howland is thriving as it is on Baker. Hermit crabs and lizards are also present, although less numerous than on Baker. Howland also has several low scrub trees (about 10' tall), while Baker has none. These trees do not provide shade, however, as their leaves are sparse, and they are filled with nesting boobies. Earhart Light is the major landmark, and, although not functional, is in relatively good condition.</p><p>Prior to landing on both Baker and Howland Island, FWS asked that all passengers deep-clean their clothes (including shoes), then place them in a freezer for 24 hours. This was to prevent the introduction into these pristine environments of alien organisms such as seeds or bacteria</p>",4
4,1,"I arrived unexpectedly to Pitcairn today, due to a faulty engine on the Bounty Bay.  Fellow MTP travelers Veikko Huhtala, Oili Liutu, and Elliot Koch are here for the first time, whereas this is my second visit.  I&apos;ve been surprised to find internet and fast phone service, flush toilets, and extended pavement, all of which is new in the last 7 years since I was here.  We are stranded indefinitely until the engine is fixed, but still hope to visit Ducie, Henderson and Oeno on this trip.  The voyage has had several twists and turns which will be documented later; we have only been away for 2 days, and have had about 4 changes of plan!",57
5,1,"Swains Island is one of the furthest outposts of the United States. Roughly 200 nautical miles north of Apia, Samoa, Swains is a single coral island containing a relatively large freshwater lagoon. Swains has been run since the 19th century by the Jennings Family, who send a representative to sit in the American Samoan Territorial Legislature.</p><p>On the M/V Bounty Bay&apos;s August 2008 Central Pacific Expedition, we met Alexander Jennings, the current representative, on the beach at Swains Island for all of about 5 minutes. This was because, as we arrived (bringing 2 passengers to caretake on Swains), the entire population of the island was evacuating! A pregnant woman was being moved to hospital, and all of the others (only 9 people at the time) decided they would come too.</p><p>Swains was hurt badly by Cyclone Percy in 2005, and the population has decreased since then. Alexander Jennings spoke to us of his plans for expansion and tourism on the island, which did not look promising given his rapid departure! A simple church was the only building left standing in the main village following Percy&apos;s passage, although other buildings including at least 2 residences have been repaired, and two new buildings constructed. A communications building with high surrounding wall was under construction at the time of our visit (Currently, the only outside communication capability on the island is a single-sideband radio left behind by a ham radio expedition). All of these buildings are positioned around a wide grassy clearing 100M from the beach.</p><p>Prior to his departure, Alex Jennings gave us the keys to the island&apos;s only vehicle, a white pickup truck, so that we could more easily reach the other side of the island. Four of us drove through the island&apos;s sole jungle trail to the opposite beach, site of the former copra plantation manager&apos;s family house, which was now falling down. We also visited the freshwater lagoon, and wondered at Alex&apos;s claim that a seaplane could land there and bring tourists. We thought the lagoon a bit small for that.</p><p>During the time we were exploring ashore, our two caretaker friends were boiling coconut crabs, which had been caught and saved for our visit. We ate them later onboard, as we made our way towards Nukunonu, Tokelau. Although the Tokelau government considers Swains part of their country, Alex Jennings said nothing about the issue except that he hoped for increased trade with Tokelau.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, while it took the Bounty Bay 36 hours to cross from Apia to Swains, the charter transport for the islanders covered the same distance in 9 hours, or 4 times our speed. This was one of our first indications that we were in for a long and tiring voyage across the Central Pacific!</p>",680
6,1,"Rockall is probably the most difficult island to land on in the world, due to its sheer sides and the rough surrounding North Atlantic seas, which create huge swells even in calm conditions. In 2005, I sailed with British TV personality Ben Fogle from Mallaig, Scotland, on the Eda Frandsen (<a href=""http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/"">http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/)</a> to attempt to land on Rockall, but we turned back in the middle of the night 50 nautical miles away, in the midst of a worsening gale. We spent 2 very nice days at St. Kilda and cruising the Outer Hebrides, but did not approach Rockall. Ben dropped me off at the dock in the tiny outer Hebrides settlement of Leverburgh, and eventually was able to sail back to Rockall the following week, but was unable to land. Ben writes about this adventure in his book &quot;Offshore&quot; (<a href=""http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore"">http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore).</a></p><p>In 2008, I joined &quot;Island Man&quot; Andy Strangeway, 7 other passengers, and 3 crew in Leverburgh to board the Elinca (<a href=""http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/"">http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/</a>), skippered by Angus Smith . Conditions were ideal for the voyage out; in fact, we had to motor due to lack of wind! Nevertheless, swells at Rockall ranged from 15-20 feet, making approach to the side of the island by dinghy impossible. After waiting all day in vain for the swells to subside, Angus sent out his son Innis with a kayak to investigate more closely. Videographer and erstwhile surf instructor Mark Lumsden accompanied Innis with a surfboard.</p><p>Mark astonished us all by bodysurfing the swell towards the rock, then grasping the skirt of kelp, and hauling himself up into a crag in the rock face. Having thus proven the possibility of landing, he climbed to the top and back down, then returned to the ship and gave me his wetsuit to follow. It was difficult, but I landed on the rock! Four other passengers were able to land this way (in sequence, using the same wetsuit) and two of the others were also able to scramble to the top of the rock.</p><p>Unfortunately, Andy Strangeway, the organizer, was unable to land in 2008, but the upside for MTP members is that he will organize another attempt in 2009 (<a href=""http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/"">http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/</a>).</p>",569

Several dive companies sail into the Coral Sea Islands Territory; the best being Tusa Dive company in Cairns. I chartered their boat TUSA IV to go to Willis Island, a 12 hour overnight run. The 4 inhabitants of Willis are VERY eager for outside contact, so no permits are necessary to visit. It is advisable to arrange mail delivery for the group before departing from Cairns. Note that, although P&amp;O Cruises advertises that they stop at Willis Island, this is a waste pickup service, and no passengers will be brought ashore.",13
8,1,"Clipperton Island is a remote, uninhabited and barren island 700 miles off the Pacific Coast of Mexico. It is an eerie place, and all who have attempted to settle here have either died, fled, or been driven mad (or some combination of the above). Claimed by France, the island was settled for several years by a Mexican garrison. The story of their subsequent downfall is epic in its drama. During WWII, the US Navy tried and failed to land enough equipment to construct a runway on Clipperton. The island was familiar to the US, since FDR made two fishing trips to the island.Although mainly devoid of scenery, Clipperton is home to abundant bird and sea life. The incessant frightened calls of the nesting boobies drove many visitors mad, as did the ubiquitous beady red-eyed land crabs which hide in the sand during the sunny days, then energe at night to swarm and devour any organic materials they can find. Clipperton is also home to some of the most spectacular tuna fishing in the world. In recent years, it has been visited annually by passenger sportfishing boats out of San Diego, including the Royal Star, Red Rooster, Royal Polaris, and Excel. I visited on the Royal Star, and highly recommend their service, whether or not one is a skilled angler. Landing is difficult, due to the encircling reefs, and the ubiquitous sharks. It is rare that a dinghy can actually land on the beach; the US Navy lost several vessels trying to land during WWII. I had to swim roughly 50M through the surf in order to land, and ruined my camera along the way!",10

11,1,"Malpelo is a dramatic, barren rock some 300 miles off the Colombian Pacific coast. Six Colombian sailors and marines stand watch on the island, extending Colombia&apos;s territorial waters far into the Pacific. These troops have little to do on the desolate islands, and are rotated monthly. Because Malpelo is designated a National Park, a permit must be obtained from the Colombian Ministry of the Environment before landing can be considered. And even if a permit and sea transportation is obtained, landing is still difficult. Because of the sheer cliffs on all sides, the only access is via a steel catwalk drilled into a cliff face. A Colombian Marine will release a rope ladder from the catwalk, and the landing party must jump from his boat onto the rope ladder, climb up to the catwalk, then scramble up a steep rock face (there are no paths) to the shack where the 6 troops live. </P><P>The only company visiting Malpelo regularly is the Dive liveaboard company Undersea Hunter.

13,1,"Chechnya is an Autonomous Republic of Russia located in the northern foothills of the Caucasus mountains. Because of the rugged terrain, and history of violence and criminal activity in the area, Chechnya has historically been the most dangerous place in the most dangerous region of Russia. Currently, police, army and Chechen rebels operate in a complex web of shifting alliances and organized crime, with ubiquitous checkpoints throughout the region, making it nearly impossible for a foreigner to even approach Chechnya, let alone enter, without a full military escort.<BR></P><P>The safest large city near Chechnya is Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia. The main road from Vladikavkaz to Chechnya passes through Nazran and Ingushetia. However, due to heavy security, and the presence of armed gangs, it is inadvisable to use this road when traveling privately. On the opposite side of Chechnya lies Dagestan, which is often just as dangerous, and so an approach from the East is inadvisable. There is no legal border crossing between Chechnya and the Republic of Georgia, although terrorists have in the past used the rugged mountain trails to occupy small villages in the Pankisi Gorge area of Georgia. Assistance in counterterrorism in the Pankisi area is the primary tactical reason that the US military has given for its presence in Georgia. The safest border area to Chechnya lies to the northwest. If already in North Ossetia, there is a small border post east of the town of Mozdok. The Russian army staff there are friendly and will not ask for bribes, which is almost unheard of in the region. They will however, call in the KGB to interview any foreigners, so one should be prepared for that. If one has not yet entered North Ossetia, it might be better to approach Chechnya by flying to Mineraly Vody, and traveling by land to the main road/rail border at Terek. Of course, this all assumes that the traveler has a valid visa to travel freely within Russia. Normal Russian tourist visas must specify exact dates and locations of travel, and cities anywhere in the Caucasus, let alone Chechnya, will normally not be approved. The easiest way to get around this is to obtain a Russian Tourist Visa Support Letter, which eliminates the need to show specific hotel reservations and other travel plans in advance of obtaining a visa. For non-Russian speakers, it is also highly recommended to travel with a Russian-speaking guide who is familiar with the region. For travel within Russia, Charles uses Mikhail ""Misha"" Rybochkin, a former paratrooper and current translator. </P>",486

16,1,"Banaba, or Ocean Island is a small, phosphorus-producing island near the Equator in the Western Pacific. Today, it is part of Kirbati, but Banaba is geographically distinct from the Gilberts, and Banabans have always had a separate language and culture from Gilbert Islanders. <P>In the early 20th century, Britain annexed Banaba to the Gilbert &amp; Ellice Islands because of its commercial potential.

0,53,"Cruising The Kimberley<br><br>by Bill Altaffer, San Diego<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>In June 2010, a group of 81 Australians and 2 Americans arrived in Broome, Western Australia, eager to embark on a 10-day expedition cruise on the MV Orion along the Kimberley Coast to Darwin.  The Orion is a purpose-built ship, capable of exploring the bays and inlets of this dramatically beautiful, unspoiled coastline, home of salt-water crocodiles, pearl farms and Aboriginal rock art.  <br><br> <br><br>Included in the cruise package was one night in Broome’s only 5-star resort hotel, the Pinctada at Cable Beach.  This luxurious, very comfortable hotel is located near Broome’s historical China Town with its many cafes, pearl stores and colorful gift shops.  Broome, with a population of about 15,000, is the largest town in The Kimberley, the 164,000 square mile area that comprises the upper part of Western Australia.  The entire population of The Kimberley, about the size of California, is estimated to be 38,000.  There are only two paved roads that traverse this very sparsely populated, largely undeveloped area.  <br><br> <br><br>After a restful night at the Pinctada, our luggage was whisked off to be loaded onto the Orion while we spent time exploring China Town before being bused to the dock to board the ship.  We all know people who seem to travel to complain.  If a person had complaints about the Orion, he would surely be someone impossible to please and his complaints would fall on deaf ears.  Perhaps there are less than a dozen expedition cruise lines worldwide, providing all levels of service.  Orion is at the top of the spectrum in every way.  As a veteran of approximately 20 expedition cruises with most of the different cruise lines, I feel qualified to say that no one does a better job than Orion did for us.  The entire ship is exquisite and opulent, beautifully designed with class and function to provide a 5-star experience.  All staterooms, even the lower-priced ones, are large and roomy, with queen size beds, elegant furnishings, flat screen TVs and DVD players.  We were able to keep up with world news (BBC and CNN) and could borrow DVDs from the well-stocked library.  The bathrooms, elegantly appointed, have home-sized glass-enclosed showers.  They are stocked with all the amenities, including superior quality three-ply toilet paper.  The dining room, lounge and library are just as beautiful as the staterooms.  All public areas are decorated with very good quality art, including paintings, sculptures and carvings.Another classy feature is the glass elevator, surrounded by a circular staircase.  Every detail and furnishing of the ship speaks of quality, reminiscent of aluxurious, 5-star hotel.  I tried to find a fingerprint on the glass, bronze, chrome and mirrored surfaces, but the Orion staff kept these immaculately free of smudges.  <br><br> <br><br>The ship has a spa with masseuse, a gym, a sauna, a beauty salon, an outdoor café and two lounges.  Its library, besides multitudes of books and DVDs, is stocked with a large assortment of board games.  The boutique carries all the necessities as well as a very nice assortment of clothing items and jewelry, including Paspaley pearls.  Its upper sundeck has a large jacuzzi.  Its lecture hall is the nicest, most comfortable and most efficient I have seen on any ship.  All decks have handicapped access.  The ship also boasts an embarkation platform for zodiac operations.  In short, the ship itself was lacking in nothing.  <br><br> <br><br>Food on board was exceptional in quality and variety.  The menu, always exquisitely prepared, was created by the chef of one of Australia’s finest restaurants (Serge Dansereau of Bathers Pavillion, Balmoral Beach, Sydney).  Any and all diets were taken into account.  For the passengers with food allergies or issues, substitutions and special foods were provided without any fuss.  The staff was always aware of who needed a special item, for example gluten-free toast, and that item would appear without the passenger even asking for it.  That was very impressive, considering the number of passengers and the logistics involved.  Details are Orion.  Nothing was overlooked or forgotten.  Perhaps the best way to illustrate the individual attention to detail in the culinary area is in Orion’s coffee.  Even for breakfast, there were no coffee pots full of mass-produced coffee waiting to be poured.  When requested, each cup of coffee was brewed individually using high-end Italian espresso machines.  Each cup was always perfectly delicious.<br><br> <br><br>All expedition cruises include lecturers.  Orion is no different.  We had great lectures on history, Aboriginal culture/rock art and geology.  In my experience, no expedition cruises include entertainment.  In this, Orion is different.  We had a singing piano player who performed during Happy Hour and after dinner.  He was excellent.  Other amenities:  towels placed on the sides of zodiacs for us to sit on, sun block and insect repellent on the embarkation platform, and even sanitizing hand cleaner in all the rooms and strategic spots around the ship, including the dining room.  The Filipino crew could not do enough for us.  Since Australians do not customarily tip, tipping was not expected on the Orion.  Therefore, the crew’s friendliness and attention to our comfort was genuine and not based on the expectation of monetary reward.  Our cruise of 83 people was served by 76 staff and crew, a ratio that insured excellent care.  <br><br> <br><br>Mike Taylor, the ship’s Scottish captain now living in Miami, was a very colorful and friendly addition to the experience.  He would join us frequently, in particular at the buffet breakfasts and lunches on the back deck.  He commented that most cruise ships in today’s world are focused inwardly.  The ship itself has become the experience, providing ice skating, rock climbing, surfing on board, Broadway shows and shopping, just for starters.  The cruise destination hardly matters.  But Orion is different.  Orion passengers are pampered and couldn’t be more comfortable on board, but the focus of the cruise is on outward experiences.  The Kimberley coast is a perfect itinerary for such a ship.<br><br> <br><br>Every day along the coast, we had disembarkations or zodiac cruises that were included in the itinerary.  In addition, at most of the locations, there were optional excursions that could be enjoyed for costs ranging from $60 to $475 (Australian).  In most of these cases, every effort was made to insure that a person could participate in the included activity as well as the optional one.  This was possible with very few exceptions, in spite of logistical difficulties.  One of the interesting optional activities was fishing.  A professional fishing guide, along with his fishing boat, was on board.  Each day, his boat was unloaded from the Orion for a morning and an afternoon fishing excursion for 2-4 participants each time.  Another feature unique to Orion, in my experience, was a tender in addition to the multitude of zodiacs for the daily excursions.  For those individuals who were physically challenged by getting in and out of a zodiac, or who preferred to be under shade rather than in the tropical sun, or for whatever reason, the tender was available.  It could not go quite everywhere the zodiacs went, but allowed people to experience nearly as much instead of remaining on board as they would have done otherwise.  As for the zodiacs, uniquely in my experience, they were outfitted with seats when the excursion involved long zodiac cruising.  Yes!  Seats!  Very comfortable bench seats with backrests!  These were securely tied into the zodiacs, three to a zodiac.  While each seat could have held 3 people, Orion’s policy is to load no more than 6 people in a seated zodiac for maximum enjoyment of the experience.  This enhanced the cruising more than I can express, providing comfort that was very easy to get used to.  <br><br> <br><br>After departing Broome in the afternoon of June 10, we sailed toward Cape Leveque for our first zodiac landing the next day.  This would be our only chance to enjoy a beach during the cruise due to the presence of salt-water crocodiles(salties) everywhere else.  Cape Leveque is a stunningly pristine, miles-long expanse of sparkling white sand with a backdrop of dunes and the red-orange sandstone features of the Cape.  It is Aboriginal land, so we were not allowed to wander back into the dunes.  There was plenty of beachfront to explore, for a very pleasant and relaxing experience.  The water was crystal clear and refreshing, perfect for swimming.  It was an idyllic afternoon in a true tropical paradise.  Of course, the Orion staff was on hand under a big blue umbrella with water, juice and sunblock for the duration.  <br><br> <br><br>The next day, Saturday June 12, we were in Talbot Bay, home of the Horizontal Waterfalls.  The entire Kimberley Coast is a geologist’s dream.  The red sandstone cliffs keep a dramatic record of forces and processes that occurred overmillions of years, including sedimentary layering, up-thrusting, folding and buckling.  Every cliff has visible layers of rock, some tilted vertically and folder back over, creating a very beautiful, unique landscape.  At Talbot Bay, there are two rows of sandstone cliffs with narrow gaps in them, allowing water to flow between the rows of cliffs and behind onto the shore.  The tidal bore of this area is the third largest in the world, with daily tides of 30 feet.  When these huge quantities of water surge through these narrow gaps, the result is the dramatic Horizontal Falls.  The water cannot flow through the gaps as rapidly as the tidal forces move it, which creates cascades through the gaps, with water levels differing by several yards on either side.  Another highlight of this perfectly enjoyable cruise in our seated zodiacs was spinning in whirlpools and vortices when we cruised between the two cliffs.  Due to the specific geology of the area between the cliffs, the tidal forces created these whirlpools in one area.  They formed and then died out, over and over.  We cruised between them and on their edges and occasionally right into them for an experience unlike any I had ever had before.  In addition to its geological uniqueness, Talbot Bay also has significant bird life and gave us our first sighting of a salty.  Before heading back to the ship, we managed to puncture one of the chambers of our zodiac.  Orion staff cleverly created a temporary patch using bandages from the first aid kit.  <br><br> <br><br>The following day, we disembarked at Raft Point for a steep climb up to view old Aboriginal rock art in a saddle of rock high above the sea.  This outdoor artgallery depicted an account of the mythical Wandjinas on a Great Fish Chase and was well worth the climb.  The opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics included a huge Wandjina spirit with its distinctive halo.  We also saw our firstboab trees at the landing site.  These are related to the baobabs of Africa and Madagascar and appear alien in form, much as the Wandjinas do.  Staff, set up under their blue umbrealla, provided hiking sticks and sunblock at the beginning of the climb.  At our return, they were ready for us with juice and water.  <br><br> <br><br>The afternoon zodiac cruise at Montgomery Reef was another unique experience.  The reef is huge, covering 400 square kilometers, and is submerged during high tides.  We boarded our seated zodiacs and began cruising away from the shipthrough what appeared to be completely open water.  Before long, the tide began to go out.  This was soon apparent as the top of the reef began to appear before our eyes.  Soon, water was rushing off the reef, forming streams and cascades in a raging torrent.  It became obvious that we were in a channel with reef on either side of us.  As the water continued to flow off the reef, numerous birds (egrets, cormorants and sandpipers) landed on it, foraging for sea life trapped on the reef.As much as 15 feet of reef can be exposed at low tide.  We cruised the channel,watching the amazing sight of the reef continuing to emerge until the sun was low in the sky, then headed back toward the ship.  We took a small detour around a sandy island that had appeared with the lowering of the tide where, to our surprise, we found Orion staff esconced under their big blue umbrella, waiting to hand us more refreshments, a very nice ending to a fascinating and uniqueafternoon.<br><br> <br><br>By the following morning, we had arrived at our next destination, Mitchell River National Park, one of the nation’s newest and most inaccessible parks.  The Mitchell Plateau is scenic as well as biologically important, including small patches of rainforest along its margins and open woodlands growing aroundvalleys and by creeks.  The park contains 50 species of mammals, 220 species of birds and 86 kinds of reptiles.  The day’s optional activity was a helicopter flight to Mitchell Falls.  The included activity was an exploration of the mangrove environments of the Hunter River and Porosus Creek, seen comfortably from the bench seats of our zodiacs.   Since each zodiac with seats is limited to 6 passengers and the cruise lasted almost 3 hours, we were split in half for morning and afternoon cruising.  Due to the wild tidal fluctuations, the morning groupzipped among and between mangrove trees, their upper portions emerging fromthe water, while the afternoon group cruised by the same trees, now completely exposed on mudflats.  Both groups saw numerous salties and abundant bird life.  Our zodiac came across a young Osprey perched on the twiggy top of a dead tree, about 6-8 feet above the water.  He did not fly off, even though two more zodiacs joined us and we drifted to within a yard of him several times, giving us the best looks at an Osprey that any birder could hope for.  The backdrop for this amazing experience was the ever-beautiful red sandstone cliff that lines the gorge created by the river.<br><br> <br><br>After cruising along the coast overnight, we arrived at Vansittart Bay where we had two landings.  In the morning, we took a short guided walk away from the beach to the site of a crashed C-53 bomber, a relic from World War II.  In the afternoon, we cruised over to Jar Island where we visited two Aboriginal rock art galleries.  These were in the Gwion Gwion style, also referred to as the Bradshaw style, completely different from the Wandjina art we had seen earlier.    <br><br> <br><br>By the following morning, we had arrived at the mouth of the King George Riverwhere helicopter rides to the Falls were an optional activity.  Those who opted to enjoy only the included activity had two options.  Both options started with a zodiac excursion to the river’s double waterfalls, a trip that took a good hour each way, including side trips up canyons for the scenery, wildlife and birds.  The more hardy group disembarked their zodiacs a distance below the falls toscramble up the nearly vertical wall in what was a difficult climb over tumbled boulders and through vegetation.  At the top, a walk of about half a mile brought these intrepid people to the top of the first of the two falls.  There was time for exploring and swimming in the pools there.  Most people crossed the first river, then made their way across the broken landscape so they could also enjoy the view from the top of the second, much larger, waterfall.  After about an hour, the group clambered back down the steep climb to the waiting zodiacs where they were told not to put on their life jackets.  Both the climbing and non-climbing zodiacs headed towards the falls.  When we were near the falls, we rounded an outcropping of rock.  There, hidden from our approach, we found Orion staff in a zodiac under their blue umbrella with a tray of champagne flutes half-filled with orange juice.  At our arrival, they popped open a bottle of champagne with great ceremony, finished filling the flutes and handed them to us along with delicious ham and cheese croissants.  This was completely unexpected, instantly changing the mood from mere pleasure to festive gaiety.  As we ate and drank, we cruisedaround close to the falls, enjoying the sheer beauty and majesty of the location.  We were then instructed to gather up our life jackets and all other items that needed to stay dry.  Those were handed off to another zodiac so that we could zipunder the smaller of the falls!  The squeals and laughter from each zodiac under the blast of cold water only added to the festivity.  Finally, we retrieved our dry items and returned down the river, again enthralled by the unspoiled, majestic beauty of the gorge.  <br><br> <br><br>The next morning found us at an actual dock at an actual town, Wyndham, the northernmost town in Western Australia and the first sign of human habitation we had seen for a week.  With a population of only 1,300, Wyndham served as the gateway to our day’s adventure.  Shuttle buses operated hourly from the ship to tour the few points of interest in the town.  Each person had to choose one of two available, included options:  either a cruise down the Ord River to Lake Argyle or a scenic flight over the Bungle Bungles.  Those who chose the river cruise spoke highly of their adventure.  I opted for the flight.  Our group was bused to the local airport where we boarded small airplanes, 4 passengers to each one, so that each person had a window.  The windows were specially constructed with curved glass so that you could look straight down easily.  The flight took about 2 ½ hours, with continuous commentary from the pilot.  Some of the points of interestwe saw were the Texas Downs Station, a huge cattle ranch shaped like Texas; the Argyle Diamond mine, the world’s largest, producing 20-25% of the world’s diamonds and 90% of the world’s pink diamonds, and very impressive from the air with its Tonka-toy trucks and layer-cake levels;  Lake Argyle, the largest man-made lake in Australia; and the Bungle Bungles, sandstone towers uniquelyformed by erosion into layered beehive-shaped domes.  The Bungle Bungles, covering 45,000 hectares, were only discovered in 1982 and became a World Heritage Listed site in 2003.  We flew over them for about 20 minutes, amazed at the unique and beautiful landscape underneath us.  Eventually, we landed at the small airport in Kununurra where our bus waited to return us to Wyndham, approximately an hour’s drive.  Our driver provided commentary on the history and points of interest of the area.  Much of the movie “Australia,” starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackson, had been filmed there.  The approximately 400 people involved in the filming had lived in trailers for about 4 months, quite a diversion for the small population living in the area.  <br><br> <br><br>The next two days were spent at sea, in a curiously pointless cruise to East Timor and back.  This was necessitated by recent changes in Australian law.  If we would not have had an international destination under the new laws, the ship would not have been considered a “cruise” ship.  This would have meant that all the Filipino staff would have been required to obtain Australian work permits, an unworkable requirement.  So, to satisfy the new law, we spent two days in the rougher waters of the Timor Sea before arriving in Darwin for our disembarkation.  For me, those two days were an enjoyable time of relaxing, reading, watching TV, attending lectures and slide shows and visiting with my fellow passengers.  The dynamics of the people can make or break a cruise.  I can not say enough in praise of the Australians that shared this cruise with me.  They included the elite of Australian society and were some of the nicest, most congenial, most interesting and friendliest people I have ever traveled with.  Sharing conversation with them was a highlight of the cruise.  I’m afraid that all my future cruises will have a triple benchmark to live up to:  first, the Orion itself, a perfect ship with a perfect staff who attended to every detail and pampered while providing a true expedition experience;  second, the incredible, unspoiled and beautifully pristine Kimberley Coast, where each day brought a new, unique experience unlike anything elsewhere in the world; and third, thequality of my fellow passengers, who were, without exception, friendly, pleasant, approachable and easy to be with.  <br><br> <br><br>Orion’s motto is “A Path Less Traveled.”  For those in search of unique, stunning scenery, pristine environments and out-of-the way places, Orion is for you.  And if you would like to be pampered while on an expedition, if you enjoy delicious meals shared with interesting, fun companions, Orion will more than satisfy you.

1,53,"CORRECTION: Title displays article written about South Korea but this article is actually containing NORTH KOREA information.<br><br>A rare look into North Korea<br><br>In early October ’05, I learned that North Korea, otherwise known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, had begun allowing Americans to obtain tourist visas. As North Korea had long been closed to Westerners, I jumped on the opportunity and signed up for a tour, Oct. 7-15, with Universal Travel System.<br><br>Along with a buddy, I made my way to Beijing, China, where, after a 3-day process, we received our visas from the North Korean Embassy. If we had not previously been screened by their government a year earlier for a trip the North Korean government had then canceled for no apparent reason, the visa process probably would have been more difficult.<br><br>We joined the remaining three tour members and boarded a Russian jet for our 2-hour flight to P’yongyang, North Korea. In addition to our small group of paying tourists, the plane was packed with journalists from all over the world, all abuzz with the excitement of a rare visit to this mysterious country.<br><br>We landed at a modern, very clean terminal where, on entry (as well as on our subsequent exit from North Korea), the officials refused to stamp our passports. Before leaving the terminal, we relinquished our cell phones with the promise that they would be returned to us at our departure.<br><br>We then drove out onto a modern highway that took us by hundreds of ultramodern buildings made of granite and marble.<br><br>Our first stop was the state circus, where we were treated to an excellent performance. Upon leaving, we noticed that it had become very quiet and dark on the streets of P’yongyang. We were taken to the area called Restaurant Row for a meal that was good, as were all of our meals during our stay.<br><br>After dinner, we were deposited in the elegant, 3-story lobby of the Koryu Hotel, a solid 5-star property. The hotel was actually two 45-story towers, each topped with a revolving restaurant. Modern escalators on both sides of the marble-inlaid floor of the lobby led up to a restaurant and shop and down to a basement complete with swimming pool and all of the amenities.<br><br>Our rooms were very modern, large and clean. We found that our TVs could receive one station during the week; it broadcast a continuous program of revolutionary themes. On the weekend, a second station was available with more of the same. The hotel had no Internet service.<br><br>My first impression that day, which did not change throughout our short visit, was that I felt very comfortable and safe in P’yongyang. No area that we saw there, or saw later as we toured away from the city, had any slum or rough area to avoid after dark. What other city in the world can claim that?<br><br>All that night, as was true every night of our stay there, we could hear melodic music being broadcast hourly from the railroad station; it was very pleasant. Each morning at 7:00 we were awakened by a loud air-raid siren. On the first day, from my room 30-plus stories up, I looked down at the people beginning to stir on the streets and saw a child alone on a park swing.<br><br>Later that first morning our local guide, Jong, along with the government official who would also accompany us on our outings, met us in the lobby. Jong informed us that we were going to have a lot on our plate during the next four days, since we would be seeing as much as could possibly be crammed in. He said, “Don’t complain about it!”<br><br>His warning was prophetic. I was soon overwhelmed by the stimuli I was receiving from this truly foreign land. It was as different and unfamiliar to me as if I had landed on Mars and was experiencing Martian culture for the first time.<br><br>Our first stop that day was at the monument to Kim Il Sung, the Great Leader, where flowers were an obligatory offering. No bronze or marble had been spared in the creation of this monument. The sculptures were as fine as any in classical Europe.<br><br>Kim’s son, Kim Jong Il, is the General and Dear Leader of North Korea. His portrait, in the form of a red pin, adorns every citizen of the country. He is the author of the Juche Idea, a philosophy that covers all aspects of life. He even created a calendar that is unique in the world — year number 1 is the Great Leader’s year of birth, and each year begins on his birthday.<br><br>The Dear Leader wears many hats. We were told that he was also the architect responsible for the design of P’yongyang, a very well-planned city. Within its limits, there must be half a dozen giant stadiums, each capable of holding 120,000 people. There are at least a dozen galleries and an equal number of different types of museums throughout the city.<br>In the Fatherland Liberation War Museum, we were shown jars of what was purported to be American nerve gas and germ warfare. One section of this massive museum was devoted to the American involvement in the Korean War. Dozens of American tanks, destroyed warplanes and crashed helicopters occupied the basement. Also on display were 15 Russian MiGs which had been used by North Korea during the war.<br><br>A large model of the infamous ship USS Pueblo was on display. Later that day we visited the Pueblo itself at its permanent anchor on the river. Originally a war prize, it is now a museum.<br><br>After watching a propaganda film, we were given a tour of the ship, where over 80 Americans had been captured and held prisoner. Jong, with four of our cameras draped around his neck, photographed us there. In a rare display of humor, he said, “After I take these pictures, I am going to throw these cameras in the river!”<br><br>Eighty-four percent of the North Korean landscape is mountainous. The word p’yongyang means “flat land.”<br><br>The second night, we left the “flat land” and drove north, almost to the Chinese border. There, the highway came to an abrupt dead end at the base of a modern, 20-story, pyramid-shaped hotel, our lodgings for the night. Early the next morning I watched perhaps 150 soldiers in brown uniforms marching past the hotel. Taking their picture would have gotten me in big trouble.<br><br>The main reason for our visit to this beautiful, rustic countryside was to see the International Friendship Hall. It is actually two dramatic buildings sitting side by side, about 90% underground. In these buildings are displayed the countless gifts given to the Great Leader as well as the Dear Leader by other countries, world leaders and famous figures and organizations over the years.<br><br>Allowing one minute per exhibit, it would take a year and a half to view all of the exhibits in the 200-plus rooms in the long, high, subterranean halls. We walked for miles underground, viewing gifts from over 170 countries, including a soccer ball from Pelé, a silver bowl from Madeleine Albright and four cars from Stalin’s armored train.<br><br>Back in the capital city, we visited its Arch of Triumph, which outsizes its counterpart in Paris. P’yongyang also has the highest stone tower in the world, which is adorned with a torch at the top.<br><br>At the other end of the spectrum, we descended into the deep tunnel that leads to the metro. The tunnel was designed to do double duty as a bomb shelter. The metro itself was old but in perfect condition and without graffiti. The seats may have been made of old Naugahyde, but they were pristine.<br><br>We visited a giant stadium constructed along the Puthong River, which bisects the city, to see the Arirang, the mass games held every couple of years to commemorate significant anniversaries. These games are huge, choreographed celebrations that are beyond imagination. Acrobats soared hundreds of feet across the stadium. My jaw dropped every time I looked up. The spectacle dwarfed any Olympic opening ceremony I have seen.<br><br>These performers, like their fellow countrymen, appear to be the most disciplined people on the face of the Earth. They would have made Hitler proud. The backdrop to the performance was a group of 50,000 children holding up color-coded cards in precise unison.<br><br>On the last day of our tour, we drove to Kaesong, site of a major battle in the Korean War, and also to the DMZ at Panmunjom to see the tightest border in the world. Having taken the DMZ trip years ago from the south via Seoul, the north side seemed very relaxed in comparison. However, along the road driving south from P’yongyang, I saw many tall towers designed to stop tanks.<br><br>At the beginning of the trip, we had decided as a group that we would encourage our guides to share their genuine feelings with us. What did we learn? The best way to put it is that they hate the American government 10 times more than the Jews hate the Nazis. They have one common enemy: us!<br><br>Their animosity toward us is constantly reinforced in museums and monuments that portray the U.S. negatively. During our stay, we were always referred to as “imperialists,” and South Koreans were referred to as “puppets.” There was never any point in arguing with this view. Jong and the state national guides have been taught, and firmly believe, that we Americans are responsible for all of the shortcomings that exist in the DPRK.<br><br>When someone in our group mentioned the prosperity in South Korea, Jong replied that North Korea is rich in cultural development. He commented in turn on the phenomenon of American students shooting their teachers, something incomprehensible in his culture.<br><br>We had arrived in the DPRK one day after an important anniversary, the 60-year celebration of the creation of North Korea. It had been marked by countless soldiers goose-stepping through Kim Il Sung Square. This military image is often the only view that the outside world, through the news network, receives of North Korea. We got a very different view, including an exhibition of flowers presented to the Dear Leader from across North Korea.<br><br>In this communist, totalitarian country, there were gift shops at every local “tourist site.” In the city, every man wore a dark suit. It is a very conservative culture, with many women in the city still wearing the chi ma jogury, a traditional kimono-style dress.<br><br>Our visit had included an excellent musical review at the Children’s Palace. There, children are taught arts and crafts as well as how to play most musical instruments.<br><br>After we returned to the States, the North Korean government unfortunately reversed its policy again, once more refusing to issue tourist visas to Americans. While this restriction is in place, we will see only military images of this fascinating country. I am glad that I was able to experience its other side for a few days.<br><br>With this trip, I had visited all of the world’s capitals. After seeing North Korea, however, the thought of visiting anyplace else seems anticlimactic.<br><br>BILL ALTAFFER<br>Mammoth Lakes, CA<br><br>Mr. Altaffer is returning to North Korea in 2006, leading the Sept. 30 departure of a tour with Universal Travel System. In addition to visas ($190), costs are as follows: land portion, sharing, $3,460; single room supplement, $750; Los Angeles-Beijing airfare, $2,923 business class or $1,015 economy class, plus Beijing-P’yongyang-Beijing airfare of $500.",513
2,53,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia<br><br>Along with a group of nine other adventurers, I went on a tour of a country that few travelers have ever been allowed to visit, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), March 24-April 8, 2007.<br><br>We went with Bestway Tours & Safaris,which arranged the visas for us. For this tour, I paid about $4,500 from New York.<br><br>When King Abdullah (Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Said) of the KSA met with President Bush at Crawford, Texas, in April 2005, he agreed to allow restricted tourism to his country by Americans. Since tourist visas for Americans still did not exist, we were allowed entry to the country under work visas proclaiming us to be consultants working for Saudi Arabian Airlines, owned by King Abdullah.<br><br>The flight from JFK Airport to Jeddah on Saudi took approximately 12 hours. The plane has an area exclusively for prayer, complete with prayer rugs — never a bad thing on a flight.<br><br>Once there, our group required special handling. Public transportation does not exist in the Kingdom; everyone owns cars and there is no tourist infrastructure. Our group was met by two men who had taken turns driving a large bus over 2,000 miles from Damascus, Syria. While they drove ahead to meet us, we were treated to a very pleasant half-day train ride across the desert between Riyadh and Hofuf.<br><br>On the bus, we were transported more than 1,000 miles across the country, from the west coast (Red Sea) to the east coast (Gulf of Oman), with only one break. Throughout most of our touring, our bus was preceded and followed by a 2-car police escort. The front vehicle often had its lights flashing as it led us on our strictly controlled route.<br>At the end of our trip, the drivers delivered us to Bahrain and immediately began their drive of 2,000-plus miles back to Syria.<br><br>THE PEOPLE — The population of the Kingdom is 23 million. Of those, 16 million are Saudi. The remaining seven million comprise the workforce of KSA, expatriates from other Muslim countries. The oil-rich locals generally do not work, though the government is supposedly trying to implement Saudization in the workforce, with somewhat limited success.<br><br>The Saudi men are easily recognized by their attire: thobes (or thawbs, pure-white garments) and ghutras (red-and-white head scarves) topped with egals (black rings).<br>Saudi women all obey the strict Muslim dress code, wearing abayas (black robe-like garments covering them from neck to ankles and wrists), with black scarves covering their hair. A significant number each also covers their faces, some completely and the rest showing only their eyes. The women in our group also were required to wear the abayas and head scarves when outside of our hotels.<br><br>Saudi women are definitely second-class citizens. They are not allowed to vote or to drive cars and are restricted from entering many public places. When allowed in public buildings such as banks and pharmacies, they have separate entrances that channel them to their own area for conducting business.<br><br>OIL — First discovered in the 1930s, oil has transformed the Kingdom. Formerly it was primarily a nomadic nation, and now most of its citizens are wealthy and enjoy a very high standard of living. Very few Saudis work. Their housing is provided by the government; all education and health care is free to them, and they are not taxed.<br><br>Saudis spend some of their wealth in upscale shopping malls. Clusters of their Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari and BMW automobiles, with the occasional Lamborghini, can be seen around ultramodern buildings. Nearly everywhere, they frequent KFCs, McDonald’s, Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks.<br><br>As the Kingdom begins to exhaust its supplies of black gold in the future, it may be able to rely on untouched deposits of the yellow variety.<br><br>CRIME — Crime is practically nonexistent in Saudi Arabia, due to a combination of the culture and the severity of punishment. We became quite complacent there, not having to worry about pickpockets or other forms of crime that are rampant elsewhere. It was a refreshing change.<br><br>SITES — The common perception that the KSA has nothing to offer and little for tourists to see and do is wrong. This view perhaps legitimately results from the decades of restricted travel to the area and a lack of knowledge concerning its rich history and the thousands of years of civilization that have existed there. We were able to see only a few of KSA’s many sites of historical and cultural interest.<br><br>The Kingdom has a number of locations rich with well-preserved ancient petroglyphs. Also in great supply are forts from various historical periods.<br><br>Outside of the old city of Al Ula, we visited the ancient Nabataean tombs of Madain Saleh, dating from between 100 B.C. and A.D. 75. Madain Saleh was the sister city to Petra, the more widely known Nabataean settlement. The 150 tombs of Madain Saleh are somewhat smaller than those of Petra but are much better preserved and have inscriptions that are not found in the more famous location.<br><br>Adjacent to the tombs is the old station for the Hejaz railway, made famous by T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia). The 1,000-mile railway had been built by the Ottoman Turks to gain access to the Red Sea. It also reduced the pilgrimage across the desert to Mecca from two months to four days, simultaneously depriving Bedouin camel drivers of their long-established livelihood transporting pilgrims and goods. Lawrence was able to unite the Bedouins and destroy the railway line.<br><br>At Al Ahsa, we visited a cave complex in one of the world’s largest oases. We experienced a camel market and saw many mosques, though we were not allowed inside any.<br><br>At Dammam, we were treated to a tour of the Aramco Exhibition, which was very well done and a lot more interesting than it may sound. It details the history of oil in the country and the mechanics of oil extraction, beginning with an excellent 3-D film and continuing with state-of-the-art exhibits.<br><br>We visited a number of museums in most of the locations we toured. Several of these were excellent, including a fabulous private collection in Jeddah, the Abdul Rauf Khalil Art Museum. The exterior of this museum is an outstanding example of Arabian architecture. The items inside were in magnificent form and creatively displayed. The National Museum in Riyadh also was exemplary and boasted an excellent gift shop.<br><br>Some of our more serious photographers often were frustrated by the restrictions placed on us. In addition to the normal rules against photographing airports and anything military, there were many historic locations, archaeological sites and museums where photography was not allowed. It was never okay to photograph local women, Videocameras were even more restricted and often forbidden even where regular photography was allowed.<br>By the way, it can be cold on the bus and in your hotel. Bring a jacket.<br><br>DINING OUT — Downtown Riyadh is extremely modern, with several striking examples of futuristic architecture — all glass and steel and uniquely designed. By night, these buildings rival the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and are well worth photographing.<br><br>In keeping with the fad that few Saudis actually work, all the restaurants were run by expatriates. They were excellent. We enjoyed a great variety of cuisines, including Turkish, Lebanese, Indian, Syrian and more. Everything was made with fresh, good-quality ingredients and very well prepared. Most meals included first courses of tabbouleh, hummus, baba ghanoush and crisp, fresh salads, which we devoured without hesitation.<br><br>None of us ever got sick from eating any of the uncooked fruits or vegetables. We always were served much more food than we could possibly eat. The only difficulty we sometimes encountered was in locating a restaurant that would serve our group, due to the fact that we had three women with us. If a restaurant did not have a family section, it would only serve men and would not accommodate us.<br><br>Generally, the family section was in a separate room from the main restaurant and had its own entrance. Where a restaurant had only one large room, family areas were partitioned off with curtains. The women in our group always were very happy when they entered the family section of a restaurant because that was the only time in public when they could remove their head scarves (though not their abayas).<br><br>We were surprised to learn that there are over 250 varieties of dates grown in Saudi Arabia. Along with tiny cups of Arabian coffee flavored with cardamom, they are offered to visitors upon their arrival at most hotels, in shops and when meeting local people.<br>These dates are nothing like their poor cousins, the ones available in our grocery stores here. The Saudis obviously keep their best dates for their own consumption and export the worst. Who can blame them? We had no idea that dates could be so varied and so delicious. Now that we have tasted these jewels, we truly miss them.<br><br>SHOPPING — In the large cities, every possible item is available for purchase in all the same well-known stores that can be found anywhere else in the world. Our group was not interested in that kind of shopping. The shoppers in our group were interested in three things: gold jewelry, Bedouin items and rugs. They were not disappointed.<br><br>The gold souks and shops were dazzling, selling only 21-karat white and yellow gold items of astonishing beauty. Some in our group were thrilled to find very interesting, unique, antique Bedouin jewelry and accessories that cannot be purchased anywhere else. The many rug shops carried large inventories of items hand-knotted in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere.<br><br>All of our shoppers had positive experiences dealing with the shopkeepers, who seemed to be unfailingly honest, giving our shoppers reasonable prices and fair exchange rates when receiving U.S. dollars. None of our shoppers ever felt they were being gouged or taken advantage of.<br><br>THE CAUSEWAY — On our last day, our Syrian drivers took us over the King Fahad causeway to Bahrain. The causeway is a 4-lane, 26-kilometer, spectacular road construction project financed by KSA to the tune of $1.2 billion dollars in 1986. We were told that in a normal day 10,000 cars cross it in both directions. On the weekends (Thursday and Friday), as many as 40,000 cars cross it in one direction only, primarily Saudis heading to and from their more relaxed neighbor for weekend fun.<br>We had the misfortune of crossing on a Thursday.

The arrival card you complete before landing states clearly, in red letters, that drug trafficking will result in death. Their laws mean what they say. There is no community service.

3,53,"From Vladivostok to Sakhalin Island — rediscovering the Russian Far East by Bill Altaffer, Mammoth Lakes, CA<br>After an overnight in Seoul, South Korea, one of the most populated cities in the world today, our MIR Corp. tour group flew to Vladivostok, our entry and exit city for the Russian Far East.First stop, Vladivostok Between the end of World War II and the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, Vladivostok was off-limits to foreigners and most Russians. Today it is a sister city to San Diego and is a lucrative base for international commerce due to its deep harbor, averaging 295 ice-free days a year.Our base in Vladivostok was the 4-star Hotel Hyundai, located in the town center close to the seaport, theaters, a historical museum and a philharmonic hall.During our day and a half in Vladivostok we explored some of its sights. After stopping at a large square dominated by huge statues of revolutionary figures, we walked along the embankment, passing monuments and boats, to a surprising sight: an S-56 submarine perched on a platform overlooking a harbor full of military vessels. Half of the submarine’s interior space has been turned into a maritime museum while the remainder shows living and working conditions as they were when the vessel was operational.From there, we went to the Eagle’s Nest observation platform for an overview of the city and Golden Horn Bay before visiting the ornate railroad station, built in 1912 and decorated with Socialist-Realist artwork.After lunch at a local restaurant, we went to a private museum of restored old cars and motorcycles, then took a walk through part of the Vladivostok Naval Cemetery to see graves and monuments from the days of the White Army through the Vietnam War era.In contrast to these more somber sights, we found chic restaurants and shops to be all the rage in today’s Vladivostok.On to Yakutsk A 3-hour flight took us to Yakutsk, boasting the coldest recorded temperature of any city. It is also the only large city in the world built on permafrost. The top layer of permafrost thaws in the summer, creating large swampy areas and plaguing the countryside outside the city with swarms of mosquitoes.Located on the banks of the Lena River, Yakutsk is the capital of the Sakha Republic — which straddles the Arctic Circle and is the area where the majority of Russian diamonds is mined. Though there is a significant number of European Russians in Yakutsk, most faces on the street belong to the ethnically different Yakut people, the original inhabitants of the area.We found a very different Yakutsk than the one described in Jeffrey Tayler's “River of No Reprieve.” Some of us had read the book in anticipation of our trip, but we did not see any of the rough, frontier-like conditions of which he wrote. Instead, we saw iPods, the latest cell phones, rush-hour traffic, fashionably dressed girls in micro-miniskirts, and even billboards for the latest Harry Potter film, at the time not even released in New York.Due to our remote location (and after reading Tayler's book), we had expected a basic, substandard hotel in Yakutsk. We were surprised to find the Polar Star Hotel to be a true 4-star establishment, with a beautiful lobby dominated by a fountain and a pair of 7-story glass elevators. The triple entry doors, providing extra insulation between the lobby and the outside elements, reminded us of our Arctic location and its winter conditions. Internet service in the hotel was fast and inexpensive.Within walking distance of the hotel was a square with a large statue of Lenin. In contrast to the rest of Russia, most Siberian cities have chosen to keep their Lenin statues as historical monuments.Some unusual museums We spent a day and a half exploring Yakutsk. Our first stop was at a beautifully restored Russian Orthodox church with gleaming golden domes. Next we visited the Institute of Permafrost and descended a 66-foot-deep shaft into the permafrost itself, where the temperature remains a constant -5° centigrade (23°F) year ’round. There, researchers study the plants and animals preserved in the permafrost as well as the effect of climate changes.We then went to the only museum in the world dedicated to the khomus, or Jew’s harp. Possibly one of the first musical instruments ever created, it is a small metal device that produces a very twangy sound through a combination of rhythmic breathing and strumming.The curator was passionate about the subject, reviewing every exhibit in detail and then performing for us. Two in our group each purchased a Jew’s harp and found that, though the instrument appeared primitive and created (to our ears) a decidedly non musical sound, it is not easy to learn to play.We also visited the Museum of the Mammoth, whose well-done displays included the skeletons of mammoths and rhinos that had been discovered in the area.A highlight of the day was our visit to the Ytyk Khaya Ethno-complex, a re-creation of a traditional Yakut village. It was built, and is maintained and added to annually, by one family with the goal of preserving the ancient traditions of the area’s indigenous people.The matriarch of the family gave us a very interesting tour that came from her heart. Before we left, she gave each of us beautiful amulets of cloth, beads and reindeer hide made by her and her daughters.On the river At the end of our first full day, we drove a half hour out of Yakutsk for a huge, delicious home-cooked dinner with a three-generation family at their farm. Late in the afternoon of the second day, we boarded the riverboat Demian Bednyi for a 48-hour cruise on the Lena River, one of the cleanest rivers in the world.Our expectations of an old, run-down riverboat were shattered by the reality of a modern, well-appointed, large party boat with nice cabins and a beautiful dining room. Those in our group, along with a couple from South Africa, were the only non-Russians among the 186 passengers. Most of the other passengers were young, very hip people from the area on board for a weekend of relaxation, dancing and fun.After breakfast the first day, we spent time watching the unspoiled, sparsely populated countryside as we cruised upriver. Mid-afternoon, we reached our destination: the Lena Pillars. These red limestone rock formations, some rising nearly 300 feet, stretch along the river for several kilometers forming a unique, dramatic shoreline.We anchored and disembarked for a Shamanistic welcoming ceremony and a hike to the top of the pillars. The path was steep and strenuous, but the view at the top, looking down on the river, the countryside and the pillars, made it well worth the effort.The next day, we spent several hours at an island where the boat’s staff barbecued and passengers played volleyball and hiked, in spite of the inevitable mosquitoes. At the end of the day, we arrived back in Yakutsk for dinner and one more night in the Polar Star Hotel.Trans-Siberian Railroad We continued our journey with a flight to Irkutsk, where we were met by Alla, a lovely young woman who had been our guide there two years previously. When she heard that we were coming back, she insisted on guiding our group again, to our delight.After checking into our hotel, Alla took us out into the countryside. We stopped at a site holy to the Shamanistic people of the area, then continued to the Ust-Orda Monastery, where we were blessed by the local monk. We visited a museum of the indigenous people and finished the day with a delicious traditional dinner in a wooden yurt.The following day we took a flight to Chita, where we toured the city before boarding the Trans-Siberian Railroad. The main attraction of the city is the Decembrist Museum, located in an old church.Our train did not arrive in Chita until almost 1 a.m., at which time we boarded gratefully and settled in to sleep. This particular train had only second- and third-class cars. Our second-class car had tiny 4-berth compartments with two bunks. Conditions were cramped and basic.Toilets were at each end of the car and were barely adequate. There were no bathing facilities on the train.In the morning, we trudged approximately half a mile to the dining car for a late breakfast, passing through 13 other cars, most of which were third class. After that eye-opening experience, we were very grateful for our second-class accommodations.The second-class cars have compartments with locking doors and a hallway with windows. Passengers in third class have no privacy and less space.A third-class car does not have compartments. It is one open dormitory with more bunks instead of a hallway, six passengers packed into the space occupied by four in second class.As we negotiated between the bunks like running backs, dodging feet at knee level and ducking under dangling toes in our faces, we could see everything that the passengers were doing. Some were playing cards, some reading and some eating re hydrated foods and cooked items (primarily boiled potatoes and dumplings) that they had bought train-side at scheduled stops along the way, but most seemed to endure the ordeal by remaining comatose. We saw more than one bottle of vodka, regardless of the time of day.Many of these passengers had been on the train for two days before we got on and would remain on for two more days after we got off. We did not envy them, in particular the families with small children.Each time we traversed the gauntlet between our car and the dining car, the odors in the third-class cars were more pronounced and the people looked more bedraggled. After trudging through each car, we were rewarded with submarine-like, smoke-filled chambers at each car’s ends — the smoking sections of the train.The dining car trip was almost mind-numbing — definitely a unique experience. We may never want to repeat it in the future, but we would not want to have missed it.Reaching Birobidzhan Finally, late on our second full day on the train, we arrived at the Jewish Autonomous Oblast (or federal state) of Birobidzhan. This oblast will celebrate its 70th birthday in 2008.Before it was created, the territory was swampy marshland filled with mosquitoes. Stalin established the oblast for three reasons: first, to remove Jews from European Russia and concentrate them in one place; second, as part of the Russian push to settle Siberia, and, third, to provide a buffer composed of people he considered expendable in case of invasion from China.At the end of the Soviet period, many Jews left the area for Israel. A fair number eventually returned for a variety of reasons. Currently, the city has an active Jewish community with a modern synagogue that supports a senior center.Our hotel in Birobidzhan was the most spartan of our Siberian accommodations but was perfectly adequate. In spite of what we had been told to expect, it had hot water. After the two nights on the train, the hotel felt luxurious.Driving through the Siberian countryside, we traveled to Khabarovsk. I had been there 15 years previously when it had been my entry point to China, crossing the Amur River. The only thing that I recognized on this visit was the Russian gunboat anchored in the middle of the river.Today, Khabarovsk is a bright, colorful, vibrant city. We saw numerous sites there before visiting a private working farm 50 miles out of the city, where we had a basic farm lunch. Ours was the first American tour group to visit.That afternoon, after more sightseeing and shopping in Khabarovsk, we boarded another train. We were happy to find that this line had first-class cars with 2-berth compartments. It was a much more pleasant experience, complete with air-conditioning and an included boxed breakfast.<br><br>Komsomolsk-na-Amure Early in the morning, after a comfortable night, we arrived in Komsomolsk-na-Amure, built in 1932 as a secret city for military industries. Its position on the Amur River, the border between Russia and China, and inland of the Tartar Strait in the Pacific Ocean made it a perfect spot strategically to manufacture airplanes and submarines.Most cities in the area were founded by Cossacks and fur traders. In contrast, Komsomolsk-na-Amur was built entirely by the Komsomol, the Soviet youth organization.We spent the day touring the city and taking a short cruise on the river in a small sailboat. The primary highlight of the cruise was when our boat became stuck on a sandbar. The captain jumped into the knee-deep water and eventually wrestled his boat free.That evening, our group of eight (seven participants and our tour manager) divided up and went to three different homes for dinner. Each group had a very interesting evening with very nice people. We were surprised at the extent to which our host families had traveled internationally.Returning to Vladivostok The next leg of our tour took us by plane to Sakhalin Island. Due to the development of the oil industry in the north of the island, this is a more international — more expensive — destination than the remainder of Siberia.Sakhalin has one of the many small, alpine-like ski resorts that have popped up all over Siberia due to Putin’s interest in the sport. Our hotel, Yubileinaya Hotel, in the capital, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, was new and modern, with large, comfortable rooms. After a night there, we spent the day touring the city and taking short drives to surrounding villages.The following day we returned to Vladivostok for three more nights in the Hotel Hyundai. In our days there we visited the Fortress Museum, which had been the sea approach defense system for the city. We also enjoyed a very pleasant 2-hour cruise around Golden Horn Bay and a visit to the Arsenyev Museum, which included a lively folk performance with audience participation.We took one full day for the 5-hour drive (each way) through the Siberian taiga to visit a Siberian tiger preserve, where we saw tigers as well as a few other Siberian animals.Coming to an end After 19 days, our trip was over. We had experienced all types of transport, including trains, planes, boats, buses and vans.As I had found in my previous trip two years before, one of the highlights of MIR Corporation tours is their program of home visits and dinners with local families; we had three such home visits on this itinerary. This allowed us to meet average Siberians, see how they live, and eat the food they eat.Without it, we would have interacted only with local tour guides. Instead, we met teachers, students, engineers and other middle-class working people and their families. They shared their thoughts and feelings with us in a very meaningful way, and we connected with them, feeling like we had made real friends.This program added a whole new dimension to the trip, giving us an insight into the Siberian people we could not have gotten otherwise. The home meals were very different from our restaurant meals, and all were delicious and memorable.While the museums and other sites may blur and run together in our memories, the home visits remain highlights.Our MIR tour manager, Paul Schwartz, did an outstanding job of facilitating our way through airports, train stations and other tricky situations when knowledge of the Russian language and Russian people was critical. He kept us fully informed and highlighted the humor of every situation. We were very pleased with his flexibility, his attention to detail and his concern for our wants and needs.",568
4,53,"Siberian Odyssey: Yenisei River Cruise<br>by Bill Altaffer, Carmel Valley, California<br><br>During the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s, I did not look forward to going to Soviet Russia. It was difficult traveling there. The hotels and restaurants were uncomfortable and inhospitable. Destinations were highly controlled. It was an ordeal rather than a pleasure. Today I can’t get enough of Russia. I look forward with great anticipation to warm service and fine dining in creative, original boutique restaurants. The thread count of designer sheets in hotels is complemented by the marble décor and modern fixtures in the bathrooms. On this latest trip, our hotel in Moscow was the newly renovated Peter I in walking distance of Red Square. Its indoor swimming pool and spa rival the best anywhere else. More importantly, though still controlled to some extent, travel to most locations is possible with advance preparation.<br>Monino Aviation Museum<br><br>Because our small group of 7, plus tour manager extraordinaire Paul Schwartz, are all veterans of Russian travel, our organized excursions in Moscow avoided the obvious sites. Instead, we visited the Monino Aviation Museum (advance permission and permits required), a prime stop for anyone interested in airplanes and air flight history, though rarely included in tour itineraries. Located at a former Soviet Air Force base, the museum (mostly open air, with hangers housing very old and unique aircraft), is the largest in Russia. It includes the famous Tupelov Tu-95, a huge Cold War bomber called “The Bear,” plenty of MiGs and Yaks as well as the world’s largest helicopter, the MIL-12. Also featured is a multitude of experimental aircraft with unique designs as well as the plane that carried Khrushchev to America, a monster of an aircraft. Even the members of our group who had little knowledge of or interest in airplanes were fascinated with what we saw and appreciated the diversity and variety of aircraft on exhibit.<br>Cold War Command Post<br><br>As a contrast to our warm, sunny morning at Monino, we spent the evening 200 feet below Moscow in the secret secured command post Tagansky, an abandoned relic of the Cold War, originally built to withstand nuclear attack. The 75,000 square-foot space could have sustained 5,000 people for 3 months. Ordered by Stalin in 1951, it took 5 years to build. An interesting film on the Cold War from the Red perspective was shown by a guide dressed in period army uniform. Then following a quite realistic simulated attack by the Imperialistic West, our dinner was served in the bunker.<br>Perm<br><br>The next day, we flew to Perm Krai, an area larger than Great Britain and somewhat autonomous. (You may be aware of the Permian Period, the last part of the Paleozoic Era. Its name came from this region.) The entire area and capital city, Perm, were not included in my old 1990 USSR edition of the Lonely Planet. In fact, most of our journey, eventually reaching deep into the Arctic Circle, was off limits to any foreigner until recently and still requires advance special permission. Like so many of the positive changes one sees in Russia today, our aircraft from Moscow to Perm was new and modern. The 2-hour flight (including a 2-hour time change) was on a private Sibir Airlines S7 301 rather than on a government-owned airline. Perm is known as the Gateway to Siberia. It is located in the western foothills of the Ural Mountains on the Kama River. Technically, due to higher volume of water and more tributaries, the Kama is a larger river than the Volga, a fact not commonly known. Founded in 1723, Perm has been an important industrial and trading city and a major supplier of salt. Dockworkers carried bags of salt on their shoulders, giving rise to the nickname ""salty ears"" for Perm residents. As we found everywhere else, the people of Perm were very friendly and helpful. Our local guide, Ekaterina, did an outstanding job with her excellent command of the English language. Boris Pasternak lived in Perm when he wrote Dr. Zhivago, using it as his model for the novel’s country town. One of the interesting sites on our city tour was the house that was the inspiration for the location in the novel where Laura first met the doctor.<br><br>The countryside of Perm Krai is idyllic. Rolling hills, fields and trees are dotted with small villages. We drove through it on bumpy roads for about 60 miles to Gulag Perm 36. This is the only intact gulag facility left in Russia. Now a small museum, it is a powerful reminder of a dark period in Russia’s history and is being preserved and restored by people dedicated to keeping this history alive so that it will not be repeated. At one time, there were more gulags in Russia than villages, something over 40,000. The inhumane living conditions, starvation and torture in the gulags were horrific beyond our comprehension. After touring the facilities, we watched a well-done, informative documentary in English that detailed some of the awful conditions of Perm 36. Following this sobering experience, we drove another 60 miles or so to the village of Kungur on the banks of the Sylva River for something completely different, the Kungur Ice Caves. They are estimated to be over 10,000 years old and are a giant complex of underground lakes, frozen waterfalls and colonies of huge ice crystals. We bundled up in our warmest gear and spent nearly 2 hours enthralled by the many caverns and beautiful ice formations of this unique cave system.<br><br>At the end of the day, we returned to Perm in time for dinner in the home of a local resident. Our tour company, MIR Corporation, provides home dining as a feature of most of their tours. These often are the most memorable experiences of MIR’s trips, where we meet real, ordinary people in their own homes, see how they really live, eat the foods they eat, communicate and share ideas with them. We end up with a completely different and more in-depth understanding of Russia than we could ever have otherwise. We always feel that we have made real friends with our hosts. Our hostess in Perm spoke excellent English, besides being an outstanding cook. It was, as usual, a highlight of the trip.<br>Khokhlovka Village<br><br>The next day, we visited the Khokhlovka Village, home of an open-air Museum of Wooden Architecture outside the city. It includes numerous houses, barns, a church, a salt works and other wooden structures from the 17th century that have been collected from all over the Perm area and reconstructed. We spent several hours exploring the large grounds on a warm, beautiful day. We had views of the Kama River and ate our picnic lunch on the shore of a lovely bay. Eventually, we headed back into Perm for a few hours of free time, which we used to explore a neighborhood grocery store and a chocolate shop and to use the Internet before dinner in a local restaurant. That evening, we boarded our superior sleeping car on the train for our first train journey of the trip. During the night, we crossed over the Ural Mountains into Siberia. We relaxed on the train the whole next day as we sped through the Siberian countryside, arriving at Omsk in the evening.<br>Omsk<br><br>Omsk was founded by the Cossacks in 1716. It is a pleasant city, nestled between the Om and Irtysh rivers. It is best known as the place Dostoevsky spent his 4-year exile after his mock execution in St. Petersburg in 1849. During Russia’s Civil War, it was where the White forces, led by Admiral Kolchak, were based. We enjoyed a city tour of beautiful renovated churches, a theater and museums, ending the afternoon on a river boat ride with a huge crowd of locals enjoying the beautiful Sunday weather. Our local guide told us that we were the first American tourists she had ever had, something that we heard often during the rest of our trip.<br>Novosibirsk<br><br>The entire next day, we spent driving 400 miles to Novosibirsk. Only when one travels by road and train across Siberia can you begin to appreciate the massiveness of this land. Most of the countryside that day was relatively flat, with some woods and uncounted acreages of fields of rich black earth planted thickly with grain, rapeseed and sunflowers. The road was in very good shape. Though it was heavy with traffic, we were able to make very good time for most of the drive. Along this inter-oblast highway, our driver pointed out a recurring individual, a “lady of the night” dressed in pink. She was successfully seeking lifts from truckers and seemed to make better time on the road than we did. We stopped throughout the day at a number of gas stations, many of US quality with all the amenities. We had a delicious, inexpensive lunch mid-day. At one of our stops, our guide pointed out an overgrown area that turned out to be wild hemp. It grows profusely in the area. After we knew what to look for, we saw it all over Siberia, popping up in the middle of fields of grain and even in city lots.<br><br>Since studying Russian geography in college, I have had a fascination with Novosibirsk (New Siberia). It was the fulfillment of a long-held dream to finally arrive there. I was not disappointed. The development of Siberia parallels that of the American West in many ways. Rivers and railroads were an integral part of both chronologies. Novosibirsk is a very modern city, newly created after the Trans-Siberian Railroad was built and with all the amenities of Moscow. Its beautiful train station, from the “constructionist” era of Soviet architecture, contrasts with gleaming, almost futuristic, skyscrapers. A large statue of Lenin is surrounded by capitalistic enterprises (a coffee shop, a fitness gym, trendy clothing stores), with a huge billboard advertising Nokia in the background. Its Red Street (at 6 miles long, the longest in Siberia), is named after the color, not the Communist party. The city also boasts a monument marking what was, at one time, the geographic center of old imperialistic Russia. Triple entrance doors in many buildings are a testament to the extreme winters in the area, when temperatures commonly reach -60 F. They can range up to +115 F in summer. Our hotel in the city was an old Intourist 3-star hotel, the Sibir. It was very comfortable with international TV, air conditioning, a pool and of course a sauna.<br><br>Our city tour included a visit to the world’s only birch bark museum. We have seen birch bark crafts all over Russia, but nothing to compare to the amazingly creative items on exhibit there, objects both useful and strictly artistic. This was followed by a drive out of Novosibirsk to Akademgorodok, the Academic City commissioned by Khrushchev as a place dedicated to scientific research. It is now a desirable place to live and the home of Novosibirsk State University. As we sat down to lunch at one of the university’s restaurants, we noticed a banquet table and music. Shortly after, we were surprised to hear the wedding march, then witness the entrance of a bride and groom. It was a special treat to watch the celebrations of the wedding party. There were lively toasts and speeches against a background of American music, including songs from Uma Thurman’s movie, Kill Bill. We hated to tear ourselves away from the festivities, but were rewarded by a very interesting visit to the Geological and Mineralogical Museum. A woman scientist who had collected many of the items on exhibit led us through the museum with rapid, very entertaining commentary. We learned a lot and enjoyed doing so. Later, we visited the open-air Trans-Siberian Museum, where over 80 old steam and diesel engines and rail cars are on exhibit. Our very full day ended with dinner at the home of another local family, an extremely enjoyable experience. This dinner was an unforgettable feast of several courses hosted by truly welcoming, friendly people who kept the vodka flowing. It was a lot of fun, another highlight we will never forget.<br>Tomsk<br><br>The following morning, we loaded into a van for our 5-hour drive through flat, green land to Tomsk, founded in 1604 and one of the oldest cities in Siberia. We arrived in time for lunch in a charmingly decorated restaurant that has been in operation for 120 years. The fact that Anton Chekhov had eaten there was commemorated by a whimsical bronze statue of the man in front of the restaurant, his nose shining brightly due to years of polishing by countless hands superstitiously seeking good luck. The food was so good there that we chose to return for lunch the following day. We enjoyed the afternoon and the next day in Tomsk, a very pleasant city. We saw the largest bell in Siberia, went into a beautiful Russian Orthodox church where several babies were being baptized, visited numerous neighborhoods packed with many examples of traditional Siberian wooden architecture, and climbed to the top of an old fire watchtower for a scenic view of the entire city. Tomsk is known as the Athens of Siberia. It was bypassed by the Trans-Siberian Railroad, resulting in less western contact and a sense of remoteness from the rest of Russia. It boasts over 60 universities with a combined total of over 110,000 students. One of every three people in Tomsk is involved in education in some way. We visited the campus of Tomsk State University, the oldest university in Siberia, where one of the academics spoke to us about its history and programs.<br><br>In the afternoon of our second day in Tomsk, we caught a commuter train to connect to the Trans-Sib. Our commuter train ride, lasting about 2 ½ hours, stopped at all the small villages up to the end of the line, delivering students and workers home after their day in Tomsk. We were an unusual experience for the commuters. One man insisted on sharing his beer with us, thrilled to be meeting his very first Americans. For our part, we enjoyed seeing the farms and villages we passed and visiting with some of the locals on the train. We eventually boarded our sleeper car on the Trans-Sib for our overnight trip to Krasnoyarsk, arriving there in the morning where we were joined by our local guide, Olga, and transferred directly to the airport. Olga, who did not speak English, was intense and efficient, facilitating all our experiences over the next few days. Olga’s mission was to inform, entertain and educate us, which she did in daily lectures and informal discussions, assisted by Paul’s helpful translations. Her first duty was to deal with airport officials. We jumped through several bureaucratic hoops before being allowed to fly on a government jet to Norilsk, high above the Arctic Circle. Though we had all the requisite paperwork giving us permission to visit this semi-closed city, we were not allowed through security until it had been closely examined by several different airport officials. Norilsk, as was true for most of the cities on our trip, was not even noted on old Soviet maps or mentioned in older guidebooks.<br>Norilsk<br><br>Our arrival at the airport outside of Norilsk was marked by additional security and screening. Long after we had dealt with that red tape, we were still waiting for our luggage as it was x-rayed and examined before finally being released to the waiting crowd. As we drove toward the city, the landscape became bleaker and grimmer with each passing minute. Norilsk has been called the most polluted city on the planet. It was built on permafrost for the single purpose of exploiting the rich deposits of nickel, copper and other precious metals that lie under the frozen ground. These ores are mined and processed in huge factories whose smokestacks billow clouds of toxic particles into the air 24 hours a day. There is talk about eventually making these factories more environmentally responsible, but that will not happen any time soon. In the meantime, the air stinks and the acid rain kills all trees and other vegetation in the area. Wildlife, of course, is non-existent. We could not get over the fact that people actually live in such a poisonous environment. The factories spew out over 2 million tons (that’s over 4 billion pounds!) of sulfur dioxide each year, contributing to the astonishing fact that Norilsk, though only a tiny spot with a relatively miniscule population in a huge nation, is responsible for 2% of Russia’s annual GNP. By the time we arrived at our hotel in the city, we were already convinced that Norilsk is the worst possible place on Earth for people to live. You might expect that statement to be followed by ""but other than that…"" But there is no ""other than that!"" We never changed our minds. There can be no city on this planet worse than Norilsk.<br><br>Norilsk is located on the 69th parallel. For three months during the winter, it receives no sunlight. Its buildings crumble and sidewalks and streets buckle in their constant battle against the extreme Siberian cold. Even in the summer, it is dreary and unwelcoming due the clouds of pollution that always hover thickly over the city. It was depressing in every way. Don Parrish, a member of our group, said, ""Now I know where to come to get volunteers to go to Mars."" Olga, who had already brought 8 groups there this year, said that she often returns to her office in Krasnoyarsk asking why they don’t issue gas masks for the trip. It is a new benchmark for ugliness and miserable quality of life in a city. We are also sure that our exposure to its environment, even as brief as it was, caused the loss of a large number of our brain cells. We could not understand why people live there until we were told that they are paid considerably better than anywhere else in Russia. I was also told that there is a good thing that there are people living there: others don’t have to!<br><br>The original inhabitants of Norilsk were prisoners. Some were actual criminals, some were political prisoners, but many were arrested on trumped-up charges in order to provide a workforce for the factories. There are no roads or railroads connecting this area to the rest of Russia. The prisoners were brought up the river in barges, 2,000 people at a time, crammed inhumanely in the holds, standing-room-only, for the 5-day voyage. At arrival, if 500 people had survived the voyage, it was considered successful. When those workers died from exposure, disease, lack of adequate food and shelter, not to mention pollution-caused illnesses, more were hauled in. Many never lived out their sentences. Most that did were forced to stay in Norilsk to continue working in the factories. They had nowhere to go and no way to get there anyway. Even now, when workers retire, they are rarely able to leave. If they do, their pension is cut severely. That and other considerations keep the population stable. Presently, 68% of the population is male. The women we saw, in contrast to all the stylish beauties further south, fit well in their colorless, drab setting. No one in our group ever wants to return to Norilsk, but none of us are sorry we went there. Sometimes there are prices to pay for going where few dare to visit. We feel we experienced something completely unique and will never forget it. But we were very, very happy that we only spent 24 hours there.<br>Dudinka<br><br>As we left Norilsk and drove on one of the few local roads in the area to the town of Dudinka, the countryside gradually became less damaged by pollution. Vegetation grew on the tundra and birds flew in the air. We stopped at one point at a spring to perform a local ritual, making wishes that are guaranteed to come true. Further along, we stopped to take a short walk out onto the tundra. That allowed us to see up close all the many types of plants, tiny flowers and little berries growing there.<br>Yenisei River Cruise<br><br>After a couple of hours on the road, we arrived at Dudinka, where we boarded our Spartan vessel, the Valery Chkalov, for our 5-day cruise south and up the Yenisei River. The Yenisei, like many Siberian rivers, flows from southern regions to empty into the Arctic Ocean. Having originated in Mongolia, it is the world’s 5th longest river, something over 2,550 miles long (sources vary). The Valery Chkalov was built over 60 years ago, when no doubt it was a first-class ship. Today, it is not a tourist vessel. It is owned by the Norilsk Nickel factory. It and a sister ship make regular round-trips during ice-free months between Krasnoyarsk and Dikson on the Arctic Ocean, providing the only affordable transport for factory workers as well as the inhabitants of the small villages located on the river. At most of these villages, the ship did not stop. Rather, it slowed down so that small motorboats could pull up to deliver or retrieve passengers. The ship boasts four levels of service. We were in the first-class cabins, which were very tiny and basic. Our toilet facilities were down the hall and showers (private for our group) were on the deck below. Olga had the key to a lounge area that was for our exclusive use. There, we could relax, read, listen to Olga’s lectures and watch videos of the area. Since there were no electrical outlets in the cabins, this room was where we recharged all our batteries. Fourth-class passengers did not have cabins. They slept wherever they could, on deck or on the two small couches at Reception. Very few of the ship’s passengers are able to afford the meals in the dining room, which we usually had to ourselves. The food on board was excellent, well prepared, varied and tasty.<br>Permafrost Museum<br><br>We only made two stops where we were able to disembark briefly. The first was at the town of Igarka, known as the “Continental Gate to the Arctic Ocean,” where we made a quick dash to see the only permafrost museum in the world. It was very well-done and fascinating. Considering its remote location, we were surprised to find that it had beaten London’s National Portrait Gallery, among others, for commendation in 2002 by the European Museum of the Year Award. The average year-round temperature in Igarka is +15 F. Summer lasts only two to three weeks, creating ideal conditions for a unique permafrost research station and laboratory under 20 feet of frozen ground. Our second stop was even shorter, at a small village where most passengers disembarked in a rush to hurriedly buy assorted foods and goods at tables set up by local entrepreneurs on the shore. Items for sale included buckets of berries, cedar nuts, homemade jams and hot sauces.<br><br>During one of Olga’s twice-daily lectures and meetings, she informed us that the river was at that point over 6 miles wide (its maximum width is 30 miles). We also passed through its most narrow point, a mere 600 yards wide, where it flows through a deep canyon. On our last full day, Olga took us to the ship’s bridge where we were given champagne and certificates as we crossed the Arctic Circle. We also saw the remains of Stalin’s hut of exile on the shore. At another point, Olga told us that we were at the closest accessible spot to the 1908 Tunguska Explosion. Scientists and other interested parties could disembark there, then take a 500-mile helicopter ride to the site. Throughout our cruise up the river, we enjoyed spending our free time watching the thickly wooded riverbanks slide by. It was heartening to see so much unexploited wilderness.<br>Krasnoyarsk<br><br>After our 5-day cruise covering nearly 1,000 miles, we arrived back in Krasnoyarsk. It was founded by the Cossacks and has a very rich history. We spent one night there in an ultra-modern hotel, notable because all the mini-bar items were free of charge. The following day, we enjoyed a leisurely, very interesting tour of this pleasant city. One of the sites we visited was a monument with connections to California. It marked the spot where Nicholai Pavlovich Rezanov, a handsome Russian captain had drowned when his horse fell through ice on the river. He was on his way from California to plead with the Russian Orthodox Church to allow him to marry his sweetheart, the 16-year-old daughter of the commandant of a fort in San Francisco. She, in turn, was soliciting the Pope for permission to marry him. With the difficulties of travel and communication in those days, she waited for him for 35 years before learning of his death, at which time she joined a convent. Other locations in the city did not have such tragic stories. The city was charming, with new and modern features alongside older, traditional architecture. We took a twenty-minute drive out of town to a state-of-the-art ski resort, complete with Doppelmeyer high-speed quad ski lifts that race up the mountain slopes all year round. The latest snow-making equipment lines the sides of the slopes. That, plus temperatures as low as minus 50, assure a good skiing season. Skiing at 50 degrees below zero? Yesssss!<br><br>That night, we flew back to Moscow, gaining four hours and arriving at the Vnukovo Airport at 9:00 PM. The drive from this airport to downtown Moscow is incredible at night. The city appears magically enchanted, very much like a fairy tale, with picturesque buildings and onion-domed churches lit up colorfully and beautifully. It was a truly incredible sight, almost dream-like, and a fitting way to end our trip together.<br>Evaluation<br><br>Russia remains a fascinating place to me. It is has such a long, sad, hard history. Its people have suffered through incredibly difficult times, yet they remain warm, welcoming and strong. We all feel a real kinship with the Russian people, a feeling that is only reinforced with each visit. After 12 trips to Russia, starting in 1964, I think that I am finally beginning to understand this multi-faceted nation. It still has closed cities, 236 of them to be exact. It also has very open and engaging people, beautiful countryside, unique architecture in historical cities, excellent food and plenty of attractions to appeal to all tastes and interests. It is changing rapidly in many ways as it joins the modern world. We saw many differences between this visit and what we experienced just a year ago. For example, the women in our group noted that almost all the public toilets now carry toilet paper and have soap and running water. Even a mere year ago, very few of them did.<br><br>Everywhere, in all cities, there are monuments and fountains that work. Public places are always accented by large plantings of colorful flowers. The people have great pride in their country and their cities, and it shows. As for the people, they are as fashionable and trendy as anywhere else in the world.<br><br>So, why would an American want to visit Russia? What seems to age us is our routine. We go to the same places, eat the same foods, think the same thoughts. We tend to become stuck in ruts, going to places that feel familiar and do not threaten us.<br><br>Russia is invigorating. It is rich in history and is now amplified by a free market. Things are happening there at a very fast pace. You can see it reflected in the people you meet. Now, Russians travel the world and are knowledgeable and informed about events outside of their borders. Cities and towns across the vast landscape host excellent hotels, restaurants and resorts, all with the most modern amenities. Only by going will you know the excitement of experiencing Russia today. You ask, ""But is it safe?"" Oh, please!<br><br>Whether you are making your first visit to Russia and want a “normal” itinerary to the obligatory spots or want to explore some of the innumerable, rarely visited, remote areas of the country, I highly recommend MIR Corporation in Seattle. They know Russia. After traveling there many times, I am finally beginning to know it, too.",735
5,53,"Siberian Odyssey: Yenisei River Cruise<br>by Bill Altaffer, Carmel Valley, California<br><br>During the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s, I did not look forward to going to Soviet Russia. It was difficult traveling there. The hotels and restaurants were uncomfortable and inhospitable. Destinations were highly controlled. It was an ordeal rather than a pleasure. Today I can’t get enough of Russia. I look forward with great anticipation to warm service and fine dining in creative, original boutique restaurants. The thread count of designer sheets in hotels is complemented by the marble décor and modern fixtures in the bathrooms. On this latest trip, our hotel in Moscow was the newly renovated Peter I in walking distance of Red Square. Its indoor swimming pool and spa rival the best anywhere else. More importantly, though still controlled to some extent, travel to most locations is possible with advance preparation.<br>Monino Aviation Museum<br><br>Because our small group of 7, plus tour manager extraordinaire Paul Schwartz, are all veterans of Russian travel, our organized excursions in Moscow avoided the obvious sites. Instead, we visited the Monino Aviation Museum (advance permission and permits required), a prime stop for anyone interested in airplanes and air flight history, though rarely included in tour itineraries. Located at a former Soviet Air Force base, the museum (mostly open air, with hangers housing very old and unique aircraft), is the largest in Russia. It includes the famous Tupelov Tu-95, a huge Cold War bomber called “The Bear,” plenty of MiGs and Yaks as well as the world’s largest helicopter, the MIL-12. Also featured is a multitude of experimental aircraft with unique designs as well as the plane that carried Khrushchev to America, a monster of an aircraft. Even the members of our group who had little knowledge of or interest in airplanes were fascinated with what we saw and appreciated the diversity and variety of aircraft on exhibit.<br>Cold War Command Post<br><br>As a contrast to our warm, sunny morning at Monino, we spent the evening 200 feet below Moscow in the secret secured command post Tagansky, an abandoned relic of the Cold War, originally built to withstand nuclear attack. The 75,000 square-foot space could have sustained 5,000 people for 3 months. Ordered by Stalin in 1951, it took 5 years to build. An interesting film on the Cold War from the Red perspective was shown by a guide dressed in period army uniform. Then following a quite realistic simulated attack by the Imperialistic West, our dinner was served in the bunker.<br>Perm<br><br>The next day, we flew to Perm Krai, an area larger than Great Britain and somewhat autonomous. (You may be aware of the Permian Period, the last part of the Paleozoic Era. Its name came from this region.) The entire area and capital city, Perm, were not included in my old 1990 USSR edition of the Lonely Planet. In fact, most of our journey, eventually reaching deep into the Arctic Circle, was off limits to any foreigner until recently and still requires advance special permission. Like so many of the positive changes one sees in Russia today, our aircraft from Moscow to Perm was new and modern. The 2-hour flight (including a 2-hour time change) was on a private Sibir Airlines S7 301 rather than on a government-owned airline. Perm is known as the Gateway to Siberia. It is located in the western foothills of the Ural Mountains on the Kama River. Technically, due to higher volume of water and more tributaries, the Kama is a larger river than the Volga, a fact not commonly known. Founded in 1723, Perm has been an important industrial and trading city and a major supplier of salt. Dockworkers carried bags of salt on their shoulders, giving rise to the nickname ""salty ears"" for Perm residents. As we found everywhere else, the people of Perm were very friendly and helpful. Our local guide, Ekaterina, did an outstanding job with her excellent command of the English language. Boris Pasternak lived in Perm when he wrote Dr. Zhivago, using it as his model for the novel’s country town. One of the interesting sites on our city tour was the house that was the inspiration for the location in the novel where Laura first met the doctor.<br><br>The countryside of Perm Krai is idyllic. Rolling hills, fields and trees are dotted with small villages. We drove through it on bumpy roads for about 60 miles to Gulag Perm 36. This is the only intact gulag facility left in Russia. Now a small museum, it is a powerful reminder of a dark period in Russia’s history and is being preserved and restored by people dedicated to keeping this history alive so that it will not be repeated. At one time, there were more gulags in Russia than villages, something over 40,000. The inhumane living conditions, starvation and torture in the gulags were horrific beyond our comprehension. After touring the facilities, we watched a well-done, informative documentary in English that detailed some of the awful conditions of Perm 36. Following this sobering experience, we drove another 60 miles or so to the village of Kungur on the banks of the Sylva River for something completely different, the Kungur Ice Caves. They are estimated to be over 10,000 years old and are a giant complex of underground lakes, frozen waterfalls and colonies of huge ice crystals. We bundled up in our warmest gear and spent nearly 2 hours enthralled by the many caverns and beautiful ice formations of this unique cave system.<br><br>At the end of the day, we returned to Perm in time for dinner in the home of a local resident. Our tour company, MIR Corporation, provides home dining as a feature of most of their tours. These often are the most memorable experiences of MIR’s trips, where we meet real, ordinary people in their own homes, see how they really live, eat the foods they eat, communicate and share ideas with them. We end up with a completely different and more in-depth understanding of Russia than we could ever have otherwise. We always feel that we have made real friends with our hosts. Our hostess in Perm spoke excellent English, besides being an outstanding cook. It was, as usual, a highlight of the trip.<br>Khokhlovka Village<br><br>The next day, we visited the Khokhlovka Village, home of an open-air Museum of Wooden Architecture outside the city. It includes numerous houses, barns, a church, a salt works and other wooden structures from the 17th century that have been collected from all over the Perm area and reconstructed. We spent several hours exploring the large grounds on a warm, beautiful day. We had views of the Kama River and ate our picnic lunch on the shore of a lovely bay. Eventually, we headed back into Perm for a few hours of free time, which we used to explore a neighborhood grocery store and a chocolate shop and to use the Internet before dinner in a local restaurant. That evening, we boarded our superior sleeping car on the train for our first train journey of the trip. During the night, we crossed over the Ural Mountains into Siberia. We relaxed on the train the whole next day as we sped through the Siberian countryside, arriving at Omsk in the evening.<br>Omsk<br><br>Omsk was founded by the Cossacks in 1716. It is a pleasant city, nestled between the Om and Irtysh rivers. It is best known as the place Dostoevsky spent his 4-year exile after his mock execution in St. Petersburg in 1849. During Russia’s Civil War, it was where the White forces, led by Admiral Kolchak, were based. We enjoyed a city tour of beautiful renovated churches, a theater and museums, ending the afternoon on a river boat ride with a huge crowd of locals enjoying the beautiful Sunday weather. Our local guide told us that we were the first American tourists she had ever had, something that we heard often during the rest of our trip.<br>Novosibirsk<br><br>The entire next day, we spent driving 400 miles to Novosibirsk. Only when one travels by road and train across Siberia can you begin to appreciate the massiveness of this land. Most of the countryside that day was relatively flat, with some woods and uncounted acreages of fields of rich black earth planted thickly with grain, rapeseed and sunflowers. The road was in very good shape. Though it was heavy with traffic, we were able to make very good time for most of the drive. Along this inter-oblast highway, our driver pointed out a recurring individual, a “lady of the night” dressed in pink. She was successfully seeking lifts from truckers and seemed to make better time on the road than we did. We stopped throughout the day at a number of gas stations, many of US quality with all the amenities. We had a delicious, inexpensive lunch mid-day. At one of our stops, our guide pointed out an overgrown area that turned out to be wild hemp. It grows profusely in the area. After we knew what to look for, we saw it all over Siberia, popping up in the middle of fields of grain and even in city lots.<br><br>Since studying Russian geography in college, I have had a fascination with Novosibirsk (New Siberia). It was the fulfillment of a long-held dream to finally arrive there. I was not disappointed. The development of Siberia parallels that of the American West in many ways. Rivers and railroads were an integral part of both chronologies. Novosibirsk is a very modern city, newly created after the Trans-Siberian Railroad was built and with all the amenities of Moscow. Its beautiful train station, from the “constructionist” era of Soviet architecture, contrasts with gleaming, almost futuristic, skyscrapers. A large statue of Lenin is surrounded by capitalistic enterprises (a coffee shop, a fitness gym, trendy clothing stores), with a huge billboard advertising Nokia in the background. Its Red Street (at 6 miles long, the longest in Siberia), is named after the color, not the Communist party. The city also boasts a monument marking what was, at one time, the geographic center of old imperialistic Russia. Triple entrance doors in many buildings are a testament to the extreme winters in the area, when temperatures commonly reach -60 F. They can range up to +115 F in summer. Our hotel in the city was an old Intourist 3-star hotel, the Sibir. It was very comfortable with international TV, air conditioning, a pool and of course a sauna.<br><br>Our city tour included a visit to the world’s only birch bark museum. We have seen birch bark crafts all over Russia, but nothing to compare to the amazingly creative items on exhibit there, objects both useful and strictly artistic. This was followed by a drive out of Novosibirsk to Akademgorodok, the Academic City commissioned by Khrushchev as a place dedicated to scientific research. It is now a desirable place to live and the home of Novosibirsk State University. As we sat down to lunch at one of the university’s restaurants, we noticed a banquet table and music. Shortly after, we were surprised to hear the wedding march, then witness the entrance of a bride and groom. It was a special treat to watch the celebrations of the wedding party. There were lively toasts and speeches against a background of American music, including songs from Uma Thurman’s movie, Kill Bill. We hated to tear ourselves away from the festivities, but were rewarded by a very interesting visit to the Geological and Mineralogical Museum. A woman scientist who had collected many of the items on exhibit led us through the museum with rapid, very entertaining commentary. We learned a lot and enjoyed doing so. Later, we visited the open-air Trans-Siberian Museum, where over 80 old steam and diesel engines and rail cars are on exhibit. Our very full day ended with dinner at the home of another local family, an extremely enjoyable experience. This dinner was an unforgettable feast of several courses hosted by truly welcoming, friendly people who kept the vodka flowing. It was a lot of fun, another highlight we will never forget.<br>Tomsk<br><br>The following morning, we loaded into a van for our 5-hour drive through flat, green land to Tomsk, founded in 1604 and one of the oldest cities in Siberia. We arrived in time for lunch in a charmingly decorated restaurant that has been in operation for 120 years. The fact that Anton Chekhov had eaten there was commemorated by a whimsical bronze statue of the man in front of the restaurant, his nose shining brightly due to years of polishing by countless hands superstitiously seeking good luck. The food was so good there that we chose to return for lunch the following day. We enjoyed the afternoon and the next day in Tomsk, a very pleasant city. We saw the largest bell in Siberia, went into a beautiful Russian Orthodox church where several babies were being baptized, visited numerous neighborhoods packed with many examples of traditional Siberian wooden architecture, and climbed to the top of an old fire watchtower for a scenic view of the entire city. Tomsk is known as the Athens of Siberia. It was bypassed by the Trans-Siberian Railroad, resulting in less western contact and a sense of remoteness from the rest of Russia. It boasts over 60 universities with a combined total of over 110,000 students. One of every three people in Tomsk is involved in education in some way. We visited the campus of Tomsk State University, the oldest university in Siberia, where one of the academics spoke to us about its history and programs.<br><br>In the afternoon of our second day in Tomsk, we caught a commuter train to connect to the Trans-Sib. Our commuter train ride, lasting about 2 ½ hours, stopped at all the small villages up to the end of the line, delivering students and workers home after their day in Tomsk. We were an unusual experience for the commuters. One man insisted on sharing his beer with us, thrilled to be meeting his very first Americans. For our part, we enjoyed seeing the farms and villages we passed and visiting with some of the locals on the train. We eventually boarded our sleeper car on the Trans-Sib for our overnight trip to Krasnoyarsk, arriving there in the morning where we were joined by our local guide, Olga, and transferred directly to the airport. Olga, who did not speak English, was intense and efficient, facilitating all our experiences over the next few days. Olga’s mission was to inform, entertain and educate us, which she did in daily lectures and informal discussions, assisted by Paul’s helpful translations. Her first duty was to deal with airport officials. We jumped through several bureaucratic hoops before being allowed to fly on a government jet to Norilsk, high above the Arctic Circle. Though we had all the requisite paperwork giving us permission to visit this semi-closed city, we were not allowed through security until it had been closely examined by several different airport officials. Norilsk, as was true for most of the cities on our trip, was not even noted on old Soviet maps or mentioned in older guidebooks.<br>Norilsk<br><br>Our arrival at the airport outside of Norilsk was marked by additional security and screening. Long after we had dealt with that red tape, we were still waiting for our luggage as it was x-rayed and examined before finally being released to the waiting crowd. As we drove toward the city, the landscape became bleaker and grimmer with each passing minute. Norilsk has been called the most polluted city on the planet. It was built on permafrost for the single purpose of exploiting the rich deposits of nickel, copper and other precious metals that lie under the frozen ground. These ores are mined and processed in huge factories whose smokestacks billow clouds of toxic particles into the air 24 hours a day. There is talk about eventually making these factories more environmentally responsible, but that will not happen any time soon. In the meantime, the air stinks and the acid rain kills all trees and other vegetation in the area. Wildlife, of course, is non-existent. We could not get over the fact that people actually live in such a poisonous environment. The factories spew out over 2 million tons (that’s over 4 billion pounds!) of sulfur dioxide each year, contributing to the astonishing fact that Norilsk, though only a tiny spot with a relatively miniscule population in a huge nation, is responsible for 2% of Russia’s annual GNP. By the time we arrived at our hotel in the city, we were already convinced that Norilsk is the worst possible place on Earth for people to live. You might expect that statement to be followed by ""but other than that…"" But there is no ""other than that!"" We never changed our minds. There can be no city on this planet worse than Norilsk.<br><br>Norilsk is located on the 69th parallel. For three months during the winter, it receives no sunlight. Its buildings crumble and sidewalks and streets buckle in their constant battle against the extreme Siberian cold. Even in the summer, it is dreary and unwelcoming due the clouds of pollution that always hover thickly over the city. It was depressing in every way. Don Parrish, a member of our group, said, ""Now I know where to come to get volunteers to go to Mars.""

We took a twenty-minute drive out of town to a state-of-the-art ski resort, complete with Doppelmeyer high-speed quad ski lifts that race up the mountain slopes all year round. The latest snow-making equipment lines the sides of the slopes. That, plus temperatures as low as minus 50, assure a good skiing season. Skiing at 50 degrees below zero? Yesssss!<br><br>That night, we flew back to Moscow, gaining four hours and arriving at the Vnukovo Airport at 9:00 PM. The drive from this airport to downtown Moscow is incredible at night. The city appears magically enchanted, very much like a fairy tale, with picturesque buildings and onion-domed churches lit up colorfully and beautifully. It was a truly incredible sight, almost dream-like, and a fitting way to end our trip together.<br>Evaluation<br><br>Russia remains a fascinating place to me. It is has such a long, sad, hard history. Its people have suffered through incredibly difficult times, yet they remain warm, welcoming and strong. We all feel a real kinship with the Russian people, a feeling that is only reinforced with each visit. After 12 trips to Russia, starting in 1964, I think that I am finally beginning to understand this multi-faceted nation. It still has closed cities, 236 of them to be exact. It also has very open and engaging people, beautiful countryside, unique architecture in historical cities, excellent food and plenty of attractions to appeal to all tastes and interests. It is changing rapidly in many ways as it joins the modern world. We saw many differences between this visit and what we experienced just a year ago. For example, the women in our group noted that almost all the public toilets now carry toilet paper and have soap and running water. Even a mere year ago, very few of them did.<br><br>Everywhere, in all cities, there are monuments and fountains that work. Public places are always accented by large plantings of colorful flowers. The people have great pride in their country and their cities, and it shows. As for the people, they are as fashionable and trendy as anywhere else in the world.<br><br>So, why would an American want to visit Russia? What seems to age us is our routine. We go to the same places, eat the same foods, think the same thoughts. We tend to become stuck in ruts, going to places that feel familiar and do not threaten us.<br><br>Russia is invigorating. It is rich in history and is now amplified by a free market. Things are happening there at a very fast pace. You can see it reflected in the people you meet. Now, Russians travel the world and are knowledgeable and informed about events outside of their borders. Cities and towns across the vast landscape host excellent hotels, restaurants and resorts, all with the most modern amenities. Only by going will you know the excitement of experiencing Russia today. You ask, ""But is it safe?"" Oh, please!<br><br>Whether you are making your first visit to Russia and want a “normal” itinerary to the obligatory spots or want to explore some of the innumerable, rarely visited, remote areas of the country, I highly recommend MIR Corporation in Seattle. They know Russia. After traveling there many times, I am finally beginning to know it, too.",710
6,53,"Wake, the Alamo of the Pacific<br>by Bill Altaffer, San Diego<br><br>Since 1988, for those not in the US military, it has been virtually impossible to visit Wake Island.  Many have tried numerous times over the years.  I was one of those hopeful and frequently disappointed travelers.  After several failed attempts, I had almost given up.  Finally, in commemoration of the 68th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, permission was granted to Valor Tours and Historic Military Tours to bring a group of 141 “country baggers” and military buffs to this most difficult destination.  This group represented over a dozen nations and included many individuals both well-known and well-regarded in traveling circles, all who had been trying to get to Wake for years.  Rather than mention any names, partly for fear of leaving anyone out, I won’t.  Many others in the group were “war buffs,” people who travel the world to see battle sites and other militarily significant locations.  For the most part, we all had some historical interest in the area.    <br><br>Wake is comprised of three atolls totaling six square miles in area and located in the North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands.  Its highest elevation is 18 feet above sea level.  It was discovered in the 1500s by the Spanish and renamed two hundred years later by the master of a British trading schooner, Captain Wake.  During the 1930s, Pan American Clipper sea planes used it as a refueling stop.  Eventually, the US Navy realized its strategic importance and began to use it as a base.  <br><br>After Pearl Harbor, on December 8, 9 and 10 of 1941, Japanese air raids “softened” the island.  Flying from their airfields in the Marshall Islands, thirty-six Mitsubishi G4M “Betty” bombers destroyed much of Wake’s airfield and supply depots.  On December 11, there was more naval shelling and an attempted Japanese landing that was repulsed by valiant resistance from US forces.  Two Japanese destroyers were sunk and the remainder retreated to Kwajalein.  On December 21, facing the reality of the situation, the last US military float planes (the PBYs) departed from the island.  Two days later, the remaining military personnel and civilian contractors on Wake surrendered to invading Japanese soldiers, the first time in history that US Marines had ever surrendered.  A relief task force that had been on its way from Hawaii was recalled when only 425 miles away, leaving the island in control of the Japanese.  <br><br>The military personnel on Wake were eventually sent to concentration camps in China for the duration of the war.  The civilian contractors on the island were detained to build fortifications and defenses for the Japanese.  On October 7, 1943, the remaining civilians were brutally executed in response to a carrier strike and an expected invasion by US forces.  After the US invasion succeeded, the two top Japanese officers there were hung for this and other war crimes.  <br><br>Today, Wake is used by the Strategic Air Command as a base for tracking missile launches.  It is home to approximately 300 military and non-military support personnel.  Other than military use, its airfield has occasionally served as an emergency stop for trans-Pacific flights.  <br><br>Our tour began in Hawaii where we boarded Continental’s Air Micronesia (Air Mic) flight to Guam.  Ironically, we flew over Wake on this flight, crossing the International Date Line and losing one day and 4 hours.  A day later, our charter flight from Guam would take us back to Wake, regaining that lost day and returning us to Honolulu time even though we would still be two thirds of the way from Hawaii to the Northern Marianas.  The night before our flight to Wake, we attended a banquet at the Outrigger Hotel in Guam.  Also in attendance were current admirals and generals as well as survivors of the 1941 invasion of the island.  Opening remarks were made by Warren Wiedhan, USMC Colonel (Ret) and by Guam’s Governor Camacho.  Rear Admiral Biesel, Brigadier General Broadmeadow and Brigadier General Ruhlman also spoke to us.  <br><br>On December 12, we departed on our chartered Air Mic flight from Guam at 5:00 AM.  Continental’s top management was also on board, along with a hand-picked crew.  They were as excited as we all were.  Several of the Wake survivors on board were accompanied by their families.  Before landing, the plane circled the atoll several times, allowing passengers seated on both sides of the plane good views of this top-secret missile defense station.  Upon deplaning, most of us immediately photographed the Wake Air Station sign at the entrance to the airport lounge.  Inside were a small museum, a shop with the usual T-shirts, hats and other souvenirs, all free of tax, and a post office where mail is collected once a week, on Fridays.  Our passports were rewarded with a large Wake Island stamp, something I have long coveted.  We were then given maps and programs for our 12-hour stay.  There are no accommodations for visitors on Wake, so we arrived at sunrise and left at sunset.  Box lunches were supplied by the airline.<br><br>Our group was divided onto two buses which went off in opposite directions and eventually covered all the sites of the island.  One bus started with Prisoner’s Rock where we saw a commemorative plaque marking the location of McArthur’s meeting with Truman in 1950.  The other bus started with a visit to the Drifter’s Reef Bar & Grill, passing stores, housing and a church.  A tiki statue guarded the entrance to the bar, where we were interested to find that premium beers cost only $2.  Outside the bar, we saw a Japanese bunker that had been uprooted and moved by the last major hurricane to hit Wake.   <br><br>After our bus tours, we had free time to walk around.  Some of our group swam in the lagoon.  Wake also boasts excellent fishing and scuba diving.  As we were exploring, Wake Islanders frequently stopped to offer us a ride.  They were extremely helpful and very interested in our tour.  They treated us like important dignitaries.  Of its approximately 300 inhabitants, about half a dozen are female.  Most of the civilian workers are from Thailand.  Signs were usually written in both English and Thai.  Some of the sites we saw included the remains of the Pan American Hotel and a ramp into the ocean for seaplanes.  Large jet fuel storage tanks were scattered about the island, which also boasts a nine-hole golf course.  Remnants of a previous Brunswick bowling alley have become decorations in front of many people’s apartments.  <br><br>Towards the end of the day, Brigadier General Broadmeadow spoke in true military form as John Dale, a 90-year-old survivor of Wake, laid a wreath at the Marine Memorial honoring the past heroes of the battles and the Japanese occupation of the island.  We then boarded our flight back to Guam, full of positive memories of the experiences of our short stay.  Was the trip worth $1,000 a day?  You betcha!  Though from start to finish, it lasted less than a week, it was the best short trip I can imagine.   It was very special for all involved:  Valor Tours, Historic Military Tours, the US military, the Air Mic crew, the honored veterans, and all the rest of us.  <br><br>I am grateful for the perseverance of Valor Tours and Historic Military Tours in arranging this trip.  It took extensive work, including many visits by HMT personnel to Hawaii and the Pentagon, to put it together and get the necessary permission.  There is discussion that this tour may be repeated next year.  These two organizations also conduct many other tours to historic and military locations.  Contact Vicky at Valor Tours in Sausalito, California for more information.  <br>",79

0,98,"I took my first trip on the Amazon in 1963, in a hammock on a very small typical cargo riverboat. We were returning to Iquitos, Peru after delivering oil to Brazil. Ever since, I&apos;d wanted to go from Manaus to Belem, and in 2004 I finally made it. I had to fly from Cayenne to Belem, then to Manaus, and then find a boat. There were a number of guys soliciting passengers, and there didn&apos;t seem to be a way to see the boat you&apos;d be on, so I had to take the word of the guy I chose. The boat I ended up on was certainly not luxurious, as I saw others at the docks that appeared to be so, but it was more than adequate. There were quite a few hammock passengers, but I was older now, and chose to get a cabin. It had two ""bunks"" that were simply boards with a grass mat on them, and I had a cabin to myself. No bedding, so I had to put on more clothes at night, as it was cold then. During the day it was pleasantly warm. The single toilet doubled as a shower (over the toilet) which was for all the passengers in cabins. The cabin passengers also had a slightly better dining area, which was probably cleaner, although before I discovered that, I ate with the hammock passengers and had no complaints. The trip took four days and nights.The river itself has always interested me, and it was wonderful to see the span of the river, to see the color change of the water when other rivers flowed into it, to visit one town along the way (Santarém), to see the jungle vegetation, and especially the large shell that contains the smaller Brazil nuts (almost impossible to open), and to see the dwellings along the shore and the pirogues that came out to meet the boat. Those who had been before knew that those pirogues would be there, and threw out plastic bags tied tightly containing stuff that was probably needed. Most of them (the pirogues) had kids rowing them, and some came out with coconuts, and machetes to open them, to sell to passengers. It was quite a trick to hang onto the moving boat, prepare the coconut, and collect the money!It was definitely quite a different trip than the first one!",578
0,368,"<p>Really &#39;earned&#39; this destination. Every place is special in its own way and if you have an interest in birds or marine life then Baker and Howland have a lot to offer. If not, then it&#39;s probably not worth the trip. We were joined by dozens of dolphins on arrival at Howland, scores of flying fish leaped in front of our boat when we actually landed, and saw sharks feeding (circling/thrashing) in the distance. Pretty amazing.</p>

<p>As for the logistics, went on the the R/V Bounty Bay (aka &quot;Bouncy Bay&quot;) which operates out of the Cook Islands. This particular trip started in Apia Samoa and ended in Tuvalu.

We arrived early into MEX airport on Alaska Airlines, then took a taxi into the city. Even in the dark morning there was a lot of traffic into the city. This time we spent two nights at the Corinto Hotel near the Plaza de la Republica. Before starting our own walking tour we ate breakfast at Torteria Armando (since 1892). We visited the Correo Mayor post office, Casa de Azuelos, and had dinner at the Hosteria de Santo Domingo (since 1860). To end the evening I went back to the popular La Opera Bar (since 1876). The next day we took the bus into Mexico State to revisit the Teotihuacan pyramids. After spending two nights we took the bus to our next destination Queretaro.<br />

Flew on Alaska Airlines on an overnight flight into MEX airport. We arrived early around 530am and took a taxi to our hotel the Best Western Majestic (built 1937) located at the Zocalo in the heart of the historic district. When I went to the entrance of the hotel it looked like it was closed and no one was there. I thought they must be out of business but the taxi driver told me they close the doors to the hotels for security reasons. They wouldnt check us in this early and we had to come back at 100pm so we decided to take an early walking tour around the city. It was freezing outside I didnt realize how cold it gets at this elevation. It was still dark out so we went to a restaurant to have a very early breakfast. The restaurant Popular was near the hotel and we had a very good mexican breakfast. We walked up and down the pedestrian streets to some of the famous sites around the historic center. We spent two nights here and were able to visit the Templo Mayor, Diego Rivera mural museum, Museo de la Estampa, Palacio de Bellas Artes, Casa de Azulejos or House of Tiles and the University of Mexico UNESCO. We ate breakfast at the chain restaurant Sanborns which is located inside the House of Tiles and it is a must see, this is a very beautiful restaurant. In the evening we went to La Opera bar (since 1876) to have drinks. This was Mexican Independence week and there were many festivities that were going to take place. Due to the escalating drug cartel violence there is a huge presence of police everywhere in the DF. The Majestic hotel gave us a room with an excellent view of the Zocalo where we could see all the activities late into the evening. On our last day we took the metro to the South bus terminal and went to our next destination Cuernavaca Morelos.<br />

Departed San Jose Costa Rica I flew into Mexico DF on Mexicana Airlines. Despite all the bad publicity the city gets,its a great place to travel too. We spent 4 nights here and wished we could of stayed longer. As you can see from my aerial photo the city is huge. The people are friendly and we always felt safe even traveling around in the evenings. The hotel door man warned me not to take the green Volkswagen public taxis, but I never had an issue with them. The taxi drivers used the meter and never tried to overcharge me (or rob me). I was suprised to see the subway was kept cleaner than the ones in New York city. We went to many different restaurants to try the variety of different Mexican dishes and Italian Restaurant Trevi (since 1955). I will go back to see more of this fun city to the South. We flew on Mexicana Airlines back to LAX.</p>

We were picked up at the JNB airport by the owner of the Shoestring Airport Lodge where we would spend two nights. We were warned about the crime in the city and opted to visit during the daytime only. We bought a Gautrain pass and used this to get into the city, we also bought a two day City Sightseeing Joburg hop on and off tour bus pass. This was the best way to see the highlights of this huge city without paying for an expensive taxi. We visited the Apartheid museum, Gold Reef city casino, Top of Africa biggest building, the excellent SAB World of Beer, James Hall Museum of Transport a car fanatics dream, and Constitution Hill Old Fort Prison. We really enjoyed the city and the people, I feel the locals over exaggerate the crime. Its just like any other major city in the world where you just have to be cautious of your surroundings. We departed Joburg on British Airways back to London then Los Angeles.",378
24,6671,"We departed the Sani Pass in Lesotho by shared kombi, we got lucky because the shared kombi had two free seats available.

We had a difficult time locating the Maseru Backpackers lodge, taxi drivers didnt know where it was located. There are not that many cheap hotel options in the city center to spend the night. The locals are very friendly and we felt it was a very safe city to walk around in, albeit most people go to bed early and nothing stays open late. The next day we took a very beautiful kombi ride to Oxbow ski lodge where we would spend another night. This is a very tranquil and secluded ski lodge that gets very busy during the ski season. The days were sunny and beautiful but we always were surprised to see the locals dress as if there was a blizzard. We always were dressed in tshirts and shorts but all the locals wore jackets and beanies. The government has hired a Chinese contractor to build a new highway across this area. We hitchhiked from Oxbow halfway to a diamond mine, then took a shared kombi and taxi to Sani Pass Lodge. This hotel and hostel has the highest bar in southern Africa. This is a beautiful and secluded place and the night would get very windy and cold, so many stars to view at night. The road below which is South Africa is windy, steep, and dangerous if a vehicle does not have good brakes. The next morning we waited at the border across the road to hitchhike or take a kombi to Underberg in Kwazulu Natal South Africa.",385

We would spend one night at the Halfway House hotel (since 1872) and have a delicious steak dinner at their restaurant. The reason for coming here was to visit The Big Hole complex and museum. This was a very nice place to visit and had a lot to offer if you had a full day to enjoy the complex. We had breakfast at the Occidental Grill Bar located in the complex.

31,6671,"We crossed the border by foot from Zambia and spent the night at the Shoestrings Backpackers hostel at Victoria Falls. When we crossed the border we noticed the prices for everything we purchased doubled in price in comparison to Zambia. The USA dollar is the currency of choice here as their national currency has collapsed. We walked over to the train station to see if the passenger trains were still in operation. They offer passenger trains from Harare to Victoria Falls only. We decided on taking the long distance bus to our next stop Bulawayo where we spent two nights at Lilys backpackers lodge. We were driven around the city in her 1961 Morris Minor, an adventure in itself.

We spent the night at The Duke hotel across the street from the US Embassy. On our first day we took a boat ride to visit the Santa Mission Amerindian Community and Arrow Point resort. The highlight of the trip was flying on Roraima Airlines to KAI airport to see Kaieteur Falls, the pilot did several passes along the falls and then when we departed flew through the canyon along the river route. The view of the falls were amazing. We were lucky to see the tiny and rare Golden Frog but very few birds and no mammals at all. This was kind of a surprise due to the fact that the falls are surrounded by a vast jungle. On our fifth day we departed on Insel Air to Miami via Aruba.",170

We spent two nights at the Amandari in Ubud then went to Seminyak Bali to spend two more nights at the Villa Seminyak Estate.

I liked the hustle free Changi Airport, we had a taxi take us to the Raffles hotel (since 1887) where we would spend two nights. This traditional five star hotel is everything I expected it to be, our butler was great. The hotels representative invited us to the Long Bar to have drinks and hors doeuvres. I had to try their famous signature drink the Singapore Sling which is their most popular drink. Im glad I didnt have to pay for anything as it was very expensive. Every morning we would have breakfast in the Tiffin Room (since 1899). Since the Singapore Botanic Public Gardens is the number one tourist destination we went for a visit in the hot and very humid weather.

I told him I wanted to visit the city but he told me there was nothing for a tourist to see and not to bother with a stop over. I got off the train in Faridabad and I could see that this place didnt really offer anything for a traveler to enjoy.

It takes two hours to drive into Comrat, there is no boarder crossing. Our first stop was the Comrat Museum which the female administrator was proud to show us around. She explained everything in Russian which had to be translated to English by our guide. It could have taken us about 30 minutes to visit the museum but ended up taking us 90 minutes because of all the time wasted translating. We also visited the Cathedral of St John, government buildings, Alley of Gagauzian Glory, and Lenin statue.  After the walking tour Boris drove back to Chisinau, this was 80EUR well spent.",778

Finally after that very hot train ride we arrived in Varna. I stayed at my coworkers flat in Varna for three nights which is located next to Primorski Park and the beach. While in Varna we visited the Roman Thermae bath ruins, Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin, and St Nikolai church. The Varna tourist office offers free walking tours of the city, which I took advantage of and its well worth it. We also went on a day trip by bus to visit nearby UNESCO Nesebar.

There is not much to see here, except if you plan on relaxing at one of the resort beach hotels. I also hired a taxi to take me to the enclave Madha Oman. The enclave is about 15 minutes away and I spent an hour with the taxi which cost me 90AED. I departed Fujairah by shared taxi back to Dubai.",425
57,6671,We drove in from Tenessee to Bowling Green Kentucky where we spent one night. There are no historic hotels in this city so we spent one night at the Red Roof Inn. We visited the Corvette Museum and the cities historic district. After this visit we drove back to Nashville Tenessee.,102
58,6671,We flew into Nashville on American Airlines and spent one night at the Union Station hotel which was once the original train station. We visited the Parthenon and Historic Downtown Nashville. I ate at Jacks BBQ (since 1976) and Hattie Bs chicken. We departed on American Airlines to Washington DC.,142
59,6671,"While driving from Provence Alpes Cote d Azur we wanted to see the Pont du Gard. We arrived in the late afternoon and no one was around this UNESCO site, we were the only people there. It was like a ghost town so we walked over to the aquaduct and took some pictures. There are signs stating that you cannot walk on it, in the past people were allowed to walk on its narrow path at the top. After our brief visit we drove into Auvergne.",854
60,6671,"We took a four hour bus ride from Zacatecas to Durango arriving late in the afternoon. We didnt think there would be much to see here but the historic part of city had a lot to offer. We stayed one night at the historic Posada San Jorge built in the mid 1700s as the House of the Royal Treasury. The hotel is located on a pedestrian only street which comes alive at night with its many sidewalk cafes and restaurants. The next morning we ate breakfast at the historic Casablanca hotels restaurant. After breakfast we went to the Mine museum underneath the Plaza de Armas. Our next destination was Mazatlan Sinaloa. This bus ride took us 8 hours along the mountain ridges which offered fantastic views. There is a tunnel being built along this route which cuts through the mountains, this should cut the voyage in half.",652
61,6671,We left Aguascalientes by bus to Zacatecas. We stayed one night at the Posada Tolasa in the heart of the old city. This was an easy city to walk around and it only had a few hills. We walked up the steep hill to take the Teleferico where we boarded the cable car to the Cerro de la Bufa. This gave us a great view of this UNESCO city from way above the mountain. One place we liked was the hotel Quinta Real which is built around the old bull ring and is next to the old Aquaduct El Cubo. The next day we took a bus to our next destination Durango.,675
62,6671,"We departed San Luis Potosi to Aguascalientes where we spent one night at the Hotel Colonial, one of the oldest hotels in the city. We went to the Museum of Death located next to Templo de San Diego. The next day we took the bus to Zacatecas.",645
63,6671,"We took a bus from San Miguel de Allende Guanajuato to San Luis Potosi which took around 4 hours. Taxis are inexpensive, we took one from the bus station to the Hotel De Gante. This hotel is located in the heart of Plaza de Armas. The next day we took the bus to Aguascalientes.",667
64,6671,"Arrived by bus from Queretaro to San Miguel de Allende Guanajuato. This is where we would spend two nights at the Hostel Inn in the historic city center. I can see why 15000 expatriate Americans call this city home, the place is an architectural jewel. The city has a lot of charm with its cobblestone streets, spanish colonial buildings, and a taste for the past. I was told SMA is expensive but that is not true as we ate, toured, and transported ourselves around at very reasonable rates. There are many great souvenirs to purchase here but we had no room and did not want to carry too many things on our bus journey. I bought some pastries at La Colmena bakery opened since 1901. The next day we took a bus to Guanajuatos historic city center. We enjoyed seeing this UNESCO city and visited the Museum of the Mummies and the San Cayetano and San Ramon mines. After our visit we went back to San Miguel de Allende and the next day took the bus to out next destination San Luis Potosi.",653
65,6671,"Our bus ride from Mexico DF took about 3 hours to arrive into Queretaro. We spent one night at the Hotel Hidalgo (since 1825), it is located down the street from the beautiful La Casa de La Marquesa hotel. Since we arrived during lunch time we walked over to La Mariposa restaurant (since 1940). This is a very popular restaurant which specializes in enchiladas which we ordered and they were very delicious. The majority of the historic district is of walking distance. I wanted coffee at Starbucks which is located on the outskirts of the historic city center. It happens to be next to the Los Arcos old aqueduct. This is worth a visit, as the aqueduct resembles many that were built in Europe. We also visited La Casa de la Marquesa, and the Convento de la Santa Cruz. The next day we took the bus to San Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato.",665
66,6671,We drove our rental car from Cernobbio Lombardy into Valais Switzerland to visit this small Italian enclave. We seemed to be the only tourists walking around the tiny main street thats in front of the beautiful lake. We walked around and took photos but didnt do much more than that since there isnt too many things to do here. I bought a few postcards and we continued toward Lugano and back through Piemonte Italy toward Monaco where we would spend one night.  ,249
67,6671,"Drove from Savannah Georgia to Hilton Head Island where we spent one night at the Marriott Resort. I was surprised to see so many people on bicycles here, even riding in the rain. This is a very popular place for vacationers, we ate at Giuseppis Pizza (since 1981) in Hilton Head. Our next stop was at Charleston where we spent two nights at the Residence Inn Charleston. This was a very nice charming city to visit, with many restaurants and shops to keep us busy. We took the ferry to Fort Sumter where the Civil War started in 1861. We also visited Drayton Hall plantation which has the best preserved plantation home in the south. Our next stop was Myrtle Beach with its carnival atmosphere, this is a great place to vacation with children. We continued our drive into Wilmington North Carolina.  <br><br>JUL2009<br>While in Savannah GA we drove north toward Hilton Head Island. We didn\'t have too much time so I turned around and went back. I will have to return again for a real visit.",140
68,6671,"We departed Hong Kong and flew into Phuket on Cathay Pacific's Dragon Airlines. The Banyan Tree hotel was really nice and we enjoyed our stay there. I went to several different Thai restaurants in the area and the food was okay, I was kind of disappointed that I actually think the Thai food is better and hotter in the USA. In Phuket town we went to McDonalds and tried their corn and chocolate pies. The corn pies were delicious, the chocolate was okay. As you can see, other travelers have a lot to say about Thailand, a country well worth the visit. From here we flew to Beijing China on Dragon Air.",554
69,6671,"Our adventure started in Kotor Montenegro. We had walked into a local travel agency at the bus station to ask about bus schedules to Tirana Albania.  Three of the agents looked at us and asked why are you going to Albania, no one goes there. Also, they stated there are no buses to Shkoder or Tirana. At this point we were very suprised and getting nervous on why they gave us this look like if we were crazy.I showed them the map of the area and told them there is a road from here to there. They advised me to go to the capital Podgorica and maybe they might have buses from there to Albania. The next morning we got on a bus to Podgorica and met two east coast Americans on the bus. These passengers had traveled in Montenegro in the past and asked us where are we heading to. We told them we are going to Albania, they looked at us with a concerned face, and told us why are you going there, no one goes there. At this point we were wondering what are we getting ourselves into. Once we arrived in Podgoricas bus station I asked when is the next bus to Albania. The ticket agent told me there is no bus to Albania and why would I want to go there. She told me to ask a taxi driver to see if they will take us to the border. At this point we werent sure we wanted to go anymore. A taxi driver agreed to take us to the border, and told me only crazy tourists go there. I told him that we cant be the only tourists going to Albania. He told me that he has taken tourists to the border before, but that is maybe 3 times a year. Once we arrived at the border the customs agent handled our transfer quickly, since we were the only tourists. On the Albanian side of the border, of course there were no buses and no taxis. How do we get to Shkoder ? A man offered us a ride to Shkoder for 20EUR, so I immediately agreed. Once we arrived in Shkoder we asked to be dropped off at a bus stop so we could continue to Tirana. We boarded a bus and we were met with staring eyes since the locals seemed to have never seen foreigners before.  As we headed to Tirana, all the locals on the bus turned their heads and just stared at us.  A couple of them spoke English and were very happy to hear that Americans would come this far to vacation in their country. We had booked the Sheraton Tirana for our 3 night stay and it was as nice as any other Sheraton. Albania is a poor country but you will see many BMWs and MBenz autos everywhere. The people are very friendly and were always smiling when we would talk to them. Kruja was a nice place to visit and we spent some time  on the coast in Durres. There is a restaurant called Kolonat that is a McDonalds copy, with mcmenu items, happy meal, and copy cat packaging. Be cautious when you cross any street, the Albanians are very well known for being crazy drivers. We really enjoyed touring around in Albania with its friendly people. We wondered why such negative remarks were made before getting here. Also, we did meet other American tourists in Tirana, they were all from California.  We departed Tirana on British Airways back to London England.",237
70,6671,We drove from Myrtle Beach South Carolina into Wilmington. We stayed one night at The Wilmingtonian hotel next to the historic district. This is a small district were it comes alive in the evenings with its many restaurants and bars catering to College students. The next day we drove back to Savannah Georgia.<br><br>JUL2011<br>Flying into and out of Cancun Mexico we went through CLT airport on USAirways. I will be back for a real visit in the near future.  ,123
71,6671,"Drove in from Jacksonville Florida into Savannah. We spent the night at the Mansion on Forsyth Park. Savannah has a very nice historical district and its neighborhoods have a lot of charm. We came here to drop off our daughter at the 100th anniversary camporee of the Girl Scouts of Georgia where it all began. Girl Scout troops from throughout the United States were here to celebrate this milestone. We enjoyed ice cream at Leopold's (since 1919) in Savannah. The next day we drove to Hilton Head South Carolina. <br><br>JUL2009<br>We flew into Savannah and spent a couple of nights at the Mansion on Forsyth Park in this charming city. I rented a car and drove south and spent two nights at The Cloister at Sea Island, such a nice property.  We visited St Marys to see if we could get to Cumberland Island where JFK jr got married. The ferry doesn't run as often as we thought and missed the opportunity to visit this island. On our way back we drove to Jekyll Island and didnt stay long because of all the mosquitos that kept attacking us. Georgia is worth a visit and has a lot to offer. <br><br>AUG2008<br>Flew into Atlanta Georgia on Delta Airlines. We had a six hour layover, so we took the metro into the city. We visited the Coca Cola museum store, Hard Rock cafe and then had lunch before going back to ATL airport. Our flight to Dubai on Delta Airlines was delayed 5 hours, so we ended up with an 11 hour layover before departing for the UAE. <br><br>JUL2003<br>My coworker won a free trip to Georgia at our company Christmas party. The package included airfare, hotel and rental car. He didnt want it and gave it to me, what a nice friend. We flew into Alanta through Denver on Frontier Airlines. We stayed at the Swissotel on Peachtree Road the main highway of Atlanta. While we were here we visited Stone Mountain, Margaret Mitchell house the author of Gone with the Wind, and the Carter Library. From Atlanta we drove the boring 4 hours to Savannah, next time we will fly instead of drive. We spent a few nights at the Courtyard by Marriott Savannah Historic district. This city is a gem and has a lot to offer. We took a tour of the city to make sure we didnt miss any of the more important parts. One evening we ate at the restaurant 17Hundred90, it was expensive and not that good. We flew back nonstop to Long Beach CA on Jetblue airlines.",96
72,6671,"NOV2014 MIAMI<br>I flew roundtrip on American Airlines to Miami so I could connect to fly over to Guyana. I had a long layover so I left the MIA airport and took the bus to eat at Yambo Nicaraguan cuisine (since 1983). When I flew back to Miami from Guyana I spent the night at the Marriott Miami airport and went to South Beach to eat at Joes Stone Crab (since 1913). 
<br><br>SEP2014 MIAMI<br>
We flew into Miami on American Airlines to go on the Motorhead Motorboat heavy metal mustic cruise. While we were there we spent a couple of nights at the Hyatt Regency Miami and ate at Versailles (since 1971), S&S Diner (since 1938) and drank at Tobacco Road (since 1912) the oldest bar in the city. We boarded the Carnival Ecstasy to cruise to Key West and Cozumel Mexico. When the cruise was back in Miami we spent one more night at the Hyatt Regency Miami. We ate dinner at Puerto Sagua restaurant (since 1962) then flew out the next day back to LAX airport.<br><br>
JUN2012 JACKSONVILLE<br>We arrived on an overnight flight at Jacksonville airport on Delta Airlines and spent one night at the Residence Inn Jacksonville Airport. While in the area we visited Fort Caroline, Frances first foothold in the new world at Timucuan historic preserve. The mosquitos are very aggresive during this time of year in Florida. Our next destination was Savannah Georgia.<br><br>MAY2003 MIAMI<br>Departed LAX and arrived in Miami on American Airlines. The first two nights we spent at Doral Golf resort in Miami and spent time in South Beach and Coral Gables. We continued to Key West were we stayed another two nights at the Cheeca Lodge. The Hemingway House, lighthouse, Southernmost house, Southernmost point, were some of the places we visited. Cannot go to Key West without trying the key lime pie. After this visit we drove back to Miami were we visited Vizcaya and then flew back to LAX on American Airlines.<br><br>DEC2001 MIAMI<br>Landed in Miami with American Airlines after spending several days in San Juan Puerto Rico. On arrival our airplane had no gate available so we missed our connection to LAX airport. The airline paid for our hotel the Best Western Miami Aiport Inn probably one of the dirtiest hotels I have been to. After our short Miami visit we flew back to LAX with American Airlines.<br><br>SEP 1998 ORLANDO<br>I flew on TWA to Orlando to meet up with my friends in Kissimmee. I preferred to stay outside of the Orlando area because it cost a lot less to stay in Kissimmee. My friends and I booked a seven day cruise on the Oceanic Big Red Boat from Premier cruises. Before going on the Caribbean cruise we visited the Kennedy Space Center, which we had a good time walking through this space odyssey. After the cruise we stayed at the Super8 motel Kissimmee. We stayed a couple extra nights so we could visit Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center which the latter is overrated. My friends flew back to Los Angeles but I continued my vacation to Stevens Point Wisconsin on TWA and United Airlines to CWA airport.<br><br>NOV1993 MIAMI<br>Flew on Trans World Airlines to Miami. My father and I were visiting family. Our visit included seeing the Holocaust memorial, Viscaya, Monkey Jungle, and Coral Castle in Homestead. We flew back to LAX on TWA.",95
73,6671,"I boarded an Amtrak train from Philadelphia to Atlantic City for a grand total of $8USD. I have always wanted to visit AC, so I took this opportunity to visit this gambling city on the shore. Once you arrive at the train station there are local mini-buses that will take you to your designated hotel for free.  I stayed for one night at the Trump Taj Mahal since it is the most famous hotel casino on the boardwalk. The casinos are very nice and well maintained, but I dont have the same thoughts for the boardwalk. Many of the boardwalk stores sell cheesy souvenirs that should be thrown out. Who is buying this junk ? A few blocks away from the boardwalk are neighborhoods that are neglected, so its best to stay in the boardwalks tourist area. I departed Atlantic city and took the train to Manhattan New York.",119
74,6671,"It took us about 4 hours to go by bus from Cuernavaca Morelos to Old Acapulco. I decided on a two night stay at the Hotel Mision which is housed in an old convent building that was built in 1797. Acapulco has many resort areas but I wanted to stay in the old city center where it all started years ago. Most foreign tourists stay in the gold coast area where all the high rise and high end resorts are located. We were able to visit the Fort San Deigo, cliff divers, and take a boat ride to Isla La Roqueta. We watched the cliff divers from Hotel Mirador which has an excellent vantage point. You have to pay a small fee to enter the hotel but it includes a drink. I went to different restaurants in the area and the food was always great and inexpensive. Our next bus ride was to Zihuatanejo where we stayed one night at the Hotel Zihuatanejo Central. This is a low key tourist location which offers a lot of souvenir shops and good restaurants. The food in Mexico is great and inexpensive. We took a collectivo bus to Ixtapa to see all the beach resorts and this is where most foreign tourists stay. Ixtapa is an upscale resort area compared to Zihuatanejo and the higher prices show it. The next day we took an afternoon bus to Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan.",654
75,6671,"Departed Washington Dulles airport to Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways. I spent two nights at the Fairmont Bab Al Bahr hotel. My hotel room had a perfect view of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. I came here to see Metallica play live at the du Arena. I visited the Marina Mall and Heritage Village which is now abandoned. My next destination was Dubai which I took a bus from the main bus terminal.<br><br>
SEP2003
My friend was here for a few months working for a USA construction company, he drove out to Dubai and picked us up in his car. We spent a couple of nights at his apartment. The city was just like any other arab city before the major construction projects have taken over this Emirate. There wasnt much to do here, we visited the Hilton hotel on the beach, and ate dinner at a local Lebonese restaurant. We took a taxi van back to Dubai which there are many on this route.",421
76,6671,From Merida Spain we drove through Badajoz to Elvas. We arrived during siesta and hardly anyone was around. It seemed we were the only tourists here also. We entered a cafe where locals were enjoying some cold beer. This was a nice place to stop and Elvas had a few historical places to visit. After a brief visit we drove north to Portalegre and back into Spain. <br><br>DEC1999<br>We departed from Ayamonte Spain we drove into Portugal. It seemed that only olive trees were the only thing we were going to see on our whole trip. We finally got to Beja and spent the night at the pension Santa Barbara and enjoyed a meal at restaurant O Aficionado. On our way we continued to see castles and old bridges and no other tourists. Once we arrived in Lisbon we continued driving and spent the night in Sintra. The place we stayed at was the two star Hotel Central and from here we enjoyed walking around the city. Of course we had to visit the Pena Palace the main attraction in Sintra. Since it was winter there was hardly any tourists here and we felt we had Sintra to ourselves. We enjoyed good food and local wine at low prices. After leaving Sintra we drove to Cascais and then back to Lisbon where we spent the night at the Quality Hotel Lisboa. We flew on Trans World Airlines back to New York JFK then back home to LAX.,305
77,6671,"Flew into DXB airport from Delhi India on Emirates Airlines. 
I just wanted to spend one night at the JW Marriott Marquis before going home the next day. I did my usual tour by metro and visited the top three malls again. The new metro line is a giant leap forward in helping alleviate the road traffic but now the metro is very popular and gets very crowded. Since I just arrived from India I then realized that the UAE has really no culture to offer me, so this will most likely be the last time I stop at this tourist trap. I flew back to LAX airport on Emirates airlines.<br><br>
APR2013<br>Arrived by bus from Abu Dhabi and stayed at the Fairmont hotel, Comfort Inn and JW Marriott Marquis. Visited all the megamalls, Gold souk, Dubai museum, and the Burj Al Arab hotel. The addition of the new metro train makes getting around a lot easier than before. Departed by bus from Union bus station to my next destination Fujairah.<br><br>
AUG2008<br>We flew non stop with Delta Airlines from Atlanta into DXB airport. On this second visit things have changed a lot. The place is crowded, congested with traffic, and overtaken by lots of tourists. Dubai has a huge problem on its hands with this traffic problem and they better fix it before it gets worse. We stayed at the JW Marriott and visited the usual attractions. We went to most of the malls, Ski Dubai, and rented a car to drive to the other Emirates. The only emirate we didnt visit was Fujairah, we will have to go there on our next visit. When we departed we flew to Muscat Oman with Swiss Airlines.  <br><br>SEP2003<br>Our first time to Dubai was a nice tranquil vacation. We flew on British Airways from London into DXB airport. The flight was empty it only had a few passengers on board. Once we walked out the airport terminal there were only a couple of taxis outside, these days its a stampede to get to a taxi. Our taxi driver was an Arab woman who gave us a mini tour on the drive to our hotel. The weather was perfect and we were able to see the city before the construction boom. We spent the first nights at the Sheraton Jumeirah Beach then moved to the Hyatt Regency Dubai. While in Dubai we also visited Abu Dhabi where my brother in law was living while working for a major construction company. We departed by flying back to London on British Airways.",424

We continued our road trip and drove into Las Vegas Nevada.<br><br>DEC2008<br>
While we were in Las Vegas Nevada we drove up to St George and stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott. Driving through the mountain passes is a beautiful sight in itself. Once you cross the stateline you can tell the people of Utah are very friendly and in a good mood. We visited the Dinosaur Farm and went to Zion National Park. We were unable to drive into the park since the roads were icy. We drove out of Utah through the Las Vegas Nevada route.",145
79,6671,"After spending one night in Madrid we flew into Melillas small airport on Iberia Air Nostrum. I booked one night at the Tryp Melilla Puerto hotel which is a short walk to the center of town. This is a businessmans hotel and is in a very convenient location. After a visit to the fort Melilla La Vieja we stopped by the tourist office to get a local map. The agent was suprised that we were from Los Angeles and that we had traveled so far. She stated mostly Spaniards come here for vacation and never had Californians in her office. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.<br>People seem to live stress free without the chaos of European Spain. In the evening we went to La Cerveceria tapas bar, a very unique bar with tile everywhere. The beer was good and the tapas even better. Most MTP members seem to rush through this enclave, but we are glad we spent the night to enjoy it at a tranquil pace. The next day we had a taxi driver take us to the border, this was to be our entry point into Morocco through Nador. Melilla is very clean but once you get to the border its dirty. Unemployed Moroccans will offer to fill out the passport entry form and lead you to the entry point. I paid a euro for the help and it was an easy walk through the border, not chaotic at all. This will be a walk through the park for most MTP members. ",392

APR2012
Arrived in Milan with American Airlines and drove our rental car to the Lake Como area. We booked one night at the Regina Olga hotel in Cernobbio a very nice hotel overlooking the lake. The weather was nice and we were able to walk over to the Villa d Este the most luxurious hotel in the area. I was invited for drinks by the hotel representave which I gladly accepted. Such a nice hotel to stay at but very expensive. We had just arrived from Los Angeles and enjoying some cappuccinos and espressos in this luxurious setting helped keep me awake. Later that afternoon we went to Lake Como to visit the city it wasnt as nice as I thought it would be. The following day we drove across the border toward Lugano Switzerland to visit Campione d Italia.<br><br>

FEB1999
We flew on Trans World Airlines from New York JFK airport to Milan Malpensa airport. Since I was an airline employee I was able to sit in first class, a nice benefit for working for the company.

The next time I am in this area I will spend some time here to explore and go up to the Lake Como area.",901
81,6671,"I rented a car for 24 hours from the Dubai airport so I could visit the northern Emirates. I first drove to Sharjah where I would spend the night at the Nejoum Al Emarat hotel. The post office was nearby my hotel, I did not purchase any postage stamps as it was very crowded inside with customers. The Heritage Village was nearby but no one was around so I did not go inside to visit. Instead I departed and drove to my next destination Ajman. After spending the night in Sharjah I went back to Dubai.<br><br>
AUG2008<br>
I rented a car and drove from Dubai to the northern Emirates. It was kind of difficult locating Sharjah as we did not see any signs showing that we entered Sharjah. I asked a gas station attendant where is Sharjah and he stated we are in Sharjah now. I saw a sign for Mega Mall Sharjah and we drove to it and thats how we finally knew we were in Sharjah. Also, I was with my girlfriend and there are no officials around to stop and check marital status. We drove around freely with no hassles at all, despite what guidebooks might state. This Emirate does not have a lot to offer a tourist a reason to stay too long. We continued our drive north to Ajman.",439
82,6671,"We entered south Veneto by way of Ferrara Emilia Romagna. I drove the rental car to the VCE airport to park the car here for two days. This was supposed to be a lower priced way of getting to Venice via the airport vaporreto. It wasnt the lowest so I dropped this idea and drove back to Venices marco polo parking garage and paid the steep parking fee for two days. The vaporreto cost 6.50EUR for a one way ticket or you can walk via the bridge and get lost a bit to your destination. We finally made it to our hotel the five star Cipriani which I received two free nights through my employer. They gave me a beautiful canal view suite which was more than spacious enough to relax in, La dolce vita! It was dinner time so we dropped our luggage in the suite and took the hotels private vaporreto to San Marco square. Breakfast was included at the hotel so we enjoyed a great and memorable breakfast without having to worry about the expensive menu. We had a full day to explore the city and visited many places that also included shopping at the many stores found here. The only expensive thing in Venice is the transportation other than that we found good deals at the stores and nice quaint reasonably priced restaurants. After this memorable stay we drove back to Milan Lombardy to spend one more night before flying back to New York. <br><br>JAN1999<br>One of my favorite cities in the world is Venice. We drove from Florence Tuscany by rental car and parked it in the lot next to the train station, of course there is no use of an automobile here. This is such a unique city and I love walking through the maze of pedestrian streets. Our first night was spent at Archies (dump) then moved the next day to the one star hotel Al Gobbo. We had arrived prior to carnival and some people had their costumes and masks on which Venice is famous for. On our drive back to Milan Lombardy we stopped and spent the night in Verona, we were not aware how nice this city was. I flew on Alitalia airlines from MXP airoport to Rome Lazio.  <br><br>MAR1994<br>While I was in Rome Lazaio I decided on taking the train to Venice. I stayed at Archies for a couple of nights.

83,6671,"The Japan Tourism board offered me a free airline ticket to go and experience Japan. I took their offer and flew on Japan Airlines from LAX to Tokyo Narita airport. Friends had told me how confusing and difficult it is to get around Tokyo because mostly everything is in Japanese characters. When I arrived in Tokyo I went to the rail desk to get my JR rail voucher exchanged for my rail pass. I had purchased the seven day rail pass for about $350 USD and also bought a metro pass at a discount.  It was early in the evening when I arrived and I took the Narita Express train into the city and arrived at K\'s hostel in the Asakusa area. The travel into the city and to the hostel was straight forward and was easy to get around. I did not change money at the NRT airport  because some friends told me that Japan uses credit cards for most purchases. I found out the hard way that this is not true when I went out to get a quick dinner later that evening. McDonalds, Burger King, and 711 convenience stores did not take credit cards. I finally found one convenience store that did take credit cards. Make sure to exchange money at the airport before going into the city. I tried to withdraw money using my bank card at several bank ATM machines and it did not work.<br>Another thing I found out is that Japan is not as expensive as people say it is, things were very reasonably priced. <br>This was winter time and it gets very cold in Japan, it actually snowed a little the following day. The metro pass was great and the metro system is probably the best anywhere in the world. I went to the most popular places and visited Tokyo tower, Meiji Jingumae and the East garden of the Imperial Palace. For a free souvenir bring a blank journal with you as every train station, tower, temple, museum, and so forth has eki commemorative rubber stamps that you can add to your journal. This is better than collecting more magnets and key chains. I took full advantage of my rail pass and went to as many places I could visit. After two nights in Tokyo I flew on Japan Airlines from Tokyo HND airport to Nagasaki Kyushu.",795

Our first night was spent at the Majestic Barriere in Cannes, we had a big balcony overlooking the French Riviera. The next day we took a quick trip to Monaco before heading north. Our 2nd night was spent at the Four Seasons Provence at Terre Blanche, a very nice and tranquil area. We visited Les Baux de Provence, Tarascon, Nimes, Pont du Gard, Orange and too many other beautiful places. We continued driving west into Languedoc Roussillon.",864
85,6671,"We took the long southeast route from Florence Tuscany to San Marino. Along the way we stopped in Perugia where American Amanda Knox was recently on trial for murdering an English student. This is a very nice city, the old part sits on top of the hill. If we knew ahead of time how nice it was we would of spent the night here. Its unfortunate alot of character cities get overlooked by all the other popular destinations. We were low on euros and I attempted to get money at the bank and atm machines here with no luck. Since we had no money we continued to Assisi to have lunch and get some money. We ate at the entrance to the old city and I was able to get some euros from a banks atm. I have never had so much trouble with getting funds. We continued our drive through Marche then San Marino. ",907
86,6671,"We drove from Cinque Terre Liguria to Pisa for a quick stop to see the leaning tower. When we arrived it was very crowded as if a festival was going on. It was difficult to take pictures without a crowd of people being in your shot. After a few hours of people watching, exchanging money and purchasing souvenirs we drove to Florence. Exchange money in Pisa which you will find a much better rate than in Florence. We arrived in Florence and had to ask a local where the Ponte Vecchio is at, in which we followed the river to our Starhotel Michelangelo. Parking is expensive here even in the parking lots. From our hotel we could walk over to the main tourist spots which were overwhelmed with people. The next morning we walked around the city to see some of the main attractions but the queues were so long we decided not to waste our time since we had seen them back in 1999. We left in the afternoon and drove to out next stop Perugia Umbria.  <br><br>JAN1999<br>We flew into Milan airport on Trans World Airlines and picked up our rental car and headed south. Our first night was spent in Pisa at the Albergo Helvetia. The next day early in the morning we went to see the leaning tower. Only a few locals were around and we had the tower to ourselves. We took some nice pictures without the crowds of tourists in the background. Our next stop was Florence where we spent the night at the hotel Tina. Florence had a lot to offer and we visited the usual, Gallery Uffizi and Accademia. No visit to Florence would be complete without visiting Michelangelo's David. You pay a high price for the entrance take a photo and you leave. Our next destination was Venice Veneto where we drove through Emilia Romagna. ",906

We had scheduled a long layover flying in from Milan Italy on American Airlines. We had almost 8 hours to enjoy a quick visit to Manhattan. We took the JFK skytrain to the subway station and off we went to Manhattan, our first stop Dylans Candy bar. Next stop was Katz deli (since 1888) to enjoy their famous pastrami on rye sandwiches, expensive. Time went by fast. We walked through the SoHo district and then we headed back to JFK airport to continue our flight to LAX.  <br><br>MAR2009<br>From Atlantic City New Jersey I arrived by train into New York. I have traveled to Manhattan many times, its not a place you get tired of.  So many places to visit, explore and to try out its endless amount of restaurants. Many people say that New Yorkers are rude, I find this not to be true. I was just here for the day and flew on Icelandair from JFK airport to Reykjavik Iceland. When I returned from Iceland I stayed in New York a couple of nights at the Jumeirah Essex House (since 1931) hotel. I flew back to LAX on Delta Airlines from JFK airport.<br><br>JUL2002<br>We flew on America Trans Air through Chicago ORD to get into New York La Guardia airport. We spent four nights at the Courtyard by Marriott Midtown East which was a convenient walk to everything. We did the usual sightseeing to Times Square, World Trade center site, South Side pier, and visited a friend in Brooklyn. I finally went to Carnegie Deli to try their pastrami sandwich which two people have to share since its so big. One thing I didnt like was that you have to pay extra to share a sandwich. We flew back to LAX on America Trans Air.<br><br>NOV2001<br>This was a pre planned trip prior to the unforeseen September 11 attack on the World Trade Center. We had tickets on Continental Airlines to fly into EWR airport. This time we stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Midtown East.

MAR2009<br>
While staying at the Ritz Carlton in Georgetown DC I rented a bicycle and road over to the Arlington cemetary. I was so glad I rented this bicycle because it gave me the freedom to ride everywhere quickly, I never had to wait for a tour bus or pay for a taxi. This was ideal since I could easily lock the bicycle in front of every place I visited. My friend also lives in Arlington and we went out to have steak dinner in the Arlington area.",147

We walked around the sleepy village and took some photos and went into a restaurant which was crowded with customers enjoying their lunch. I bought some souvenirs at the only shop in town from the grumpy lady that works there. She was upset that sales were very slow, but she doesnt understand that not that many people know about this place. When we were leaving a group of tourists were arriving, so maybe that will make her happy. After our brief visit we continued our drive to La Spezia to visit Cinque Terre. ",748

91,6671,"We arrived late in the evening from Rimini Emilia Romagna due to heavy auto strata traffic. After asking a local which way to the Hotel Titano (since 1894) we arrived without getting lost. This is a small area to visit but has lots of windy roads. We liked our hotel which had a nice view of the surrounding area. San Marino is a safe and tranquil place to visit. The next day after breakfast we walked around the small city visiting the Curiosity museum, many shops, and Tower number three. This place offers great value compared to Italy, overnight parking was only 4 euro, souvenirs were inexpensive, entry fees were low and I got the best exchange rate for my dollars. It started to rain in the afternoon so we packed up and drove to Ferrara Emilia Romagna to fuel up for Venice.",308

We stayed at the Jolly hotel and went to dinner at another pasta and pizza restaurant in La Spezia. This is what we ate every night for dinner never getting tired of it. The next morning we drove to Manarola Cinque Terre a UNESCO world heritage site. There are five villages but we only had time to visit one of them. Hiking from village to village is a very popular thing to do here. You can arrive in Cinque Terre either by car, small bus, train or ferry. Our next stop was Pisa and Florence in Tuscany. ",900

I was kind of embarrassed to drive up to our hotel in a Ford wagon with so many Ferraris and Rolls Royces parked in front.<br>I was able to get a free night at the five star Hermitage hotel and I was given a beautiful suite that overlooked the riviera. We enjoyed the city by walking around everywhere. It was Easter week so many of the stores closed early but lots of people were out enjoying the nice evening. The next day we departed for La Spezia in Liguria Italy.  <br><br>SEP2004<br>While in Cannes, I was not going to pass up the opportunity to quickly visit Monte Carlo. I drove the rental car to this small city and parked next to the famous Casino. This place is well kept and you never see any trash anywhere.

When we left PA we took the Megabus back to Washington DC.

I arrived in Philadelphia by train and spent one night at the five star Rittenhouse hotel for free. Philadelphia is a great city to visit for all its historical sights. Foodies must visit either Pats or Genos cheese steak sandwich restaurants. These two fast food restaurants which are across the street from each other are an institution for their famous sandwiches. If you are a philatelist you will want to visit the B Free Franklin post office in old Philadephia. This location has a special cancellation stamp for your post cards. Its the only post office that does not display a flag or has a zip code. I continued the next day to Atlantic City New Jersey.

Walked over to the tourist information desk and got a map of the city. More young ladies were wearing kimonos so I asked for permission to take their photo which they happily accepted.  I took the metro a couple of stops to the city center. When I got off the metro by the Nagoya tower I just walked back toward the JR rail station. There was the Science museum which I was going to see but it was closed on this day. Stopped at my favorite breakfast place Yoshinoya and had breakfast for about $5USD, what a deal. While at the rail station I added the eki commerative rubber stamp to my souvenir book. These eki stamps are the best souvenirs since they dont cost anything.

I was in Takamatsu Shikoku for the day and arrived in Kyoto in the evening on my JR rail pass. I stayed two nights at Ks House Kyoto hostel. On this first night I went to dinner at a locals restaurant called Manzo and had some very good tempura. I visited Sanjusangendo Temple, The Golden Pavilion, Nijo Castle, Osaka, and Nara. On my second day I spent 15 hours straight touring all these places, the only thing that slowed me down was the very cold weather. While in Kyoto there were many young ladies wearing kimonos. I would ask them for permission to take their picture, most of them would giggle for the attention they were getting. There are collectable eki commemorative rubber stamps at all these locations so I added those to my blank page journal, its better than  getting more magnets and key chains. The places I went to were not expensive as I had been told, I ate well and visited many places without spending a lot of money. I had a nice time here but had to continue to my next stop Nagoya Chubu.",794
100,6671,"I departed Hiroshima Chugoku to Takamatsu Shikoku by JR rail. I had a seven day rail pass where I could basically go anywhere anytime and as many times as I wanted. The Hiroshima hostel receptionist was asking me why I was going to Shikoku. She said there is nothing to do there except to try out the local cuisine of udon noodles.  I arrived in Takamatsu right before lunch and that was my intention to try out the local specialty. When I arrived at the JR station I went to the information desk and asked which restaurant should I try out for the udon noodles. She wrote in Japanese characters the name of her favorite restaurant and circled the area on the map. I took the tram to the stop nearest the restaurants location and just handed the paper to any local walking by and they pointed in the direction to the restaurant.  It was a very popular restaurant and the noodles were fresh and delicious. After lunch I walked a few blocks to the Ritsurin Garden to walk around one of the most popular places to visit in Kagawa Prefecture. The gardens were very nice like all the others around Japan.  I brought with me a blank page journal that I now stamp the eki commemorative stamps that all tourists attractions in Japan happen to have. This is better than collecting magnets and key chains and the stamps dont take up any space, also they are free.  A lot of people say that Japan is expensive but I found out that my lunch and entrance to the garden cost a lot less than what it would cost in the USA. After my brief visit I boarded a JR train to Kyoto Kansai.",797

The park  has many statues and sculptures from around the world.  The Atomic Bomb museum is nearby and that was an interesting yet sad place to visit. The twenty-six Martyrs memorial was nearby so I stopped by for a visit, there is also a museum there but I did not have time to go inside. All tourist attractions have eki commemorative rubber stamps that you can add to your travel diary or book, a free souvenir to take with you.

We were able to buy tickets to take us to the border city of Chetumal. At this point we walked across the border and entered customs, we were the only people crossing. Not that many people cross through here because border security is at its minimum. A lonely taxi was waiting outside customs, he charged us $20 for four hours of driving us around to go eat and to get us to the Corozal airport. Mayan airlines took us to San Pedro on Ambergris Cay, and we were the only 3 passengers on board. This was to be a relaxing vacation without the running around we usually do in major cities. Our hotel was the Belizean Shores which is right on the beach. A big ocean front room was only $120 per night. To get around the island you either walk, bike or rent a golf cart. This is a totally layed back place to be, and even the indoor restaurants have sand as their flooring.

The taxi cost me 90AED for the one hour ride back and forth from Madha.<br><br>

We departed with Swiss Airlines from Dubai UAE into Muscat. This was a short one hour flight which had very few passengers on board. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Muscat which is located on the beach. Before we set out to visit Oman, we thought this would be the most backwards country in the region. We were wrong. Actually of all the Arabian coast countries we visited this was our favorite. The Omanis are the most friendliest and polite people in the region. Since the country is not overbuilt like Dubai it still has an Arabian feel to it. There are many Portugese built fortresses throughout the mountains that dot this country. And the Mutrah souk is where you will find all the beautiful silver, handmade in Oman. The top hotel to stay at is The Chedi - 5 stars on the beach. Very few Americans travel here but you will see many British citizens. I rented a car  and was able to get around very easily. Compared to the other Arabian countries, the Omanis keep their country clean. I rented a car and drove to as many attractions as we could get to. We visited the Childrens museum, Natural History Museum, Bait Al Baranda museum, and Mutrah fort. The food at all the restaurants we ate was really good including the Indian restaurant Mumtaz Mahal. This restaurant sits on top of a hill and is a very popular place to go to during dinner time. We departed Oman with Qatar Airways and flew over to Doha Qatar.",434

The location, culinary experience, and spa were all wonderful. One thing I am glad about this trip is that I didnt have to pay for anything. Thank goodness because everything was very expensive, this resort is not for the budget traveler. If you have the money to spend this is a very nice place to spend your vacation.

There was no more need for my rental car so I dropped it off at Hertz Marble Arch. On this visit we toured the Tower of London, Temple Church, and the UNESCO National Maritime Museum Greenwich. We found our way to the famous Brick Lane to enjoy some Indian food.

We had a two night stay at the Hotel Ritz located at Green Park where we could easily get to all the attractions in the city. David Blaine the magician was suspended in the air for several weeks.

Every year they hold Vanfest a big weekend event for Volkswagen buses. Next stop was to go to Bath where we spent the night at the St Francis hotel. After 5 days of traveling though this area we flew from London Heathrow to Dubai on British Airways.<br><br>SEP 1997<br>I flew in from Amsterdam to London Heathrow on KLM airlines. I was meeting some family members here so we could travel around England. While I waited a few days for the family to arrive I did the usual touring around London. I visited Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus, Big Ben, British Museum, Tower of London, Tower Bridge, and Harrods. This was a month after Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed died in the car accident in Paris. At Harrods they had pictures of both of them and a beautiful memorial in a display window. During this time I stayed a budget accommodation called Curzon House Hotel. When the family arrived we headed west toward Salisbury where we stayed in a very nice hotel which was more like a townhome. Since we were in this area we visited Stonehenge, Salisbury cathedral, Avebury, Beaulieu the national motor museum, Bath, Bath postal museum, and many other places.

Departed LAX to DCA airport Washington DC on Alaska Airlines. This was my 3rd trip to DC, and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Georgetown. I decided to rent a bicycle to see some sights I had missed on my prior trips. It was the best thing I did, not only did I see all the missing sights, I never had to wait for a taxi or tour bus. Forget about renting a car, traffic can be very bad and parking is not easy to find. With the $15 bicycle rental I was able to get rock star parking everywhere. My friend from Arlington Virginia picked me up to go out to dinner on the less touristy Virginia side. The next day I took the train to Baltimore Maryland.",94
109,6671,"We flew from Dublin to the Isle of Man on Aer Arann. The airfare was just a little bit more than going by ferry. We decided to spend one night here at the Claremont Hotel in Douglas. Thinking there wasnt much to do I booked one night, was I wrong. With all the island has to offer you could easily spend 5 to 7 nights here. A very enjoyable layed back place to stay with all the friendly helpful locals to look out for you. A taxi driver told me the island used to be a very popular place to visit by Brits. But with all the low priced airlines out there, the Brits are starting to venture elsewhere. We really liked it here and this should be one of your stops if you are in Ireland or England. If you are a train fanatic visiting this island should be on your list. We departed on flybe airlines to Liverpool England. ",277
110,6671,"We flew on British Airways from Doha Qatar into Bahrain. While visiting the Arabian coast we stayed in Bahrain for 3 days. The Sheraton Bahrain hotel where we spent two nights at was in a centrally located area of the city. There are only a few things for a tourist to see, so the island doesnt offer a lot. Beware of the taxi drivers as they are the worst I have encountered in the world. I was tired of arguing with them for  being overcharged, so I rented a car. This was the best thing to do since the island is very easy to navigate. We were able to see all the out of the way places at a low price, and gasoline is very inexpensive. One thing to keep in mind - Dont go during Ramadan! Everything will be closed and there wont be anything for you to do. Unless you want to lay out by the hotel pool all day, you can do that at home. Also, I was told dont get caught drinking or eating in public, its a $3000 USD fine. If you would like to purchase something unique, it would be a natural Bahrain pearl. We left Bahrain on Gulf Air and flew into Kuwait.  ",423

We parked the car at a lot across from the border and walked in. I asked the customs agent for a stamp in my passport and they stated I will get it on the way out. We bought a roundtrip bus ticket to take us to the main plaza area. While waiting for the bus to leave we saw a British Airways flight take off from the blocked road which doubles as the runway. Once we arrived at the end of the bus route we were amazed to see so many tourists here. I never knew this place was this popular, so many people at the border, the plaza, and everywhere else. We ate lunch at an Indian restaurant called Maharaja on Tuckeys Lane, the food was as good as you get it in London. We decided to walk over to the cable car that takes you to the top of the rock. It was well worth the price to the top, splendid views for great photos. You can see Morocco from this vantage point. The monkeys are very used to people and will walk very close to you. If you have a chance to spend the night it would be well worth it to stay in this lively enclave. We walked back across the border and I asked for the passport stamp, and they told me I get it on the way in. <br>With all the foot traffic I don\'t think the border agents want to be bothered. We walked back into Andalusia and continued our vacation through Spain.",269
117,6671,"Drove our rental car from Leeds England into Cardiff where we spent one night. We stayed at the Park Inn by Radisson Cardiff North which was not in the city center. You have to be very cautious driving around here as there are many speed cameras. We were here on a Saturday and a lot of stores close very early, and on Sundays everything opens late. Spillers record store has moved to a new location and it was also closed. Unfortunately we didnt get to see much because of this, and a wedding was taking place at the Castle. The next day we drove to Bath England.",328

Half of the cruisers went straight to the bars but we walked the 3 1/2 miles to Port Langosta to hang out in the old city. There are plenty of stores to shop at and some relaxing restaurants to have a few tacos and a beer.<br><br>
JUL2011<br>We flew roundtrip from LAX on US airways through Charlotte North Carolina, not the most direct route. This was a company fam to see some all inclusive hotels by Karisma. We spent three nights at the El Dorado Royale in Punta Brava the Riviera Maya. Since we were so busy we were only able to visit 5th Avenue the tourist trap of Playa del Carmen. Souvenirs are not inexpensive like they used to be, the prices were higher than what you pay in the USA or London. Despite this lack of free time we enjoyed the beautiful resort, good food and its beaches. <br><br>SEP 2006 <br>Cancun the most popular place in Mexico where American tourists vacation. We arrived on American Airlines going through Dallas. I dont care for the long strip of hotels lined up all along this beautiful coast. Too me its a tourist trap, so the best thing to do is head away from the Cancun strip for more quaint areas. I like renting a car and visiting all the ancient sites around here or heading  south toward Tulum and its beautiful beaches. Since we were here we visited Xcaret, Playa del Carmen, and Coba. We had flown into Cancun to spend a few nights at the Westin resort, but our main goal was to get to Belize. We went to the Cancun main bus station in the non tourist area. We were able to buy tickets to take us to the border city of Chetumal. At this point we walked across the border and entered customs, we were the only people crossing over to Belize. Not that many people cross through here because border security is at its minimum.<br><br>AUG1998<br>I flew from LAX through Houston to Cancun on Continental Airlines.

Luckily it wasnt a serious accident and were transfered to another bus for the final drive into the city. <br>Since I was traveling alone I stayed at the hostel Florida suites on La Florida. I noticed that the citys population has grown since coming here in MAY2001. The streets are filled with lots of traffic now and a lot more people compared to then.

Since I like staying in the old parts of cities I booked my stay at the Luna Castle hostel located in Casco Viejo. The room I shared with others had a fantastic view of the new city across the water. Since the transportation is great it was very easy to get around from place to place. The locals were always friendly and helpful. I came to Panama for two things, to see Metallica in concert and to visit the San Blas Islands. Ate some great food at the local restaurants and went to visit Panama Viejo UNESCO site and the Mira Flores canal locks. I then flew back to LAX on TACA airlines.<br><br>NOV1995<br>We were flying into San Jose Costa Rica in the evening and it was fogged in.

APR2006<br>
For Easter week we drove to Scottsdale and stayed at the Camelback Inn. We visited Tucson, Tombstone, Petrified Forest, Grand Canyon, Meteor Crater, Seligman on Route 66, and Oatman.

122,6671,Arrived by ferry from Hurghada into Sharm el Sheikh. I went diving in the Red Sea and had a nice time playing with the curious dolphins that followed us. We hiked up to Mt Sinai to watch the sunrise and stopped by St Catherines which was closed. I spent a couple of nights in Dahab where we were constantly attacked by flies during the day and mosquitos at night. This is a very layed back town that caters to young Israelis coming to party here. Everytime I walked down the dirt streets I was offered illegal drugs for sale by the locals. I was going to take the ferry from Taba to Aqaba Jordan to avoid the hassle of going through Eilat Israel. A German man living in the area advised me to go by road since the ferry is either late or never shows up. So we all continued by road from Taba through Eilat Israel and then to Aqaba Jordan. ,745

124,6671,"I passed through the high security checkpoints from Jordan into Israel. I had never seen so many checkpoints in my life. My first stop was the Dead Sea where I floated in this salty oily feeling water, it was also a bit cold. This was a very unique experience. I continued to Jerusalem where I stayed at hostal near Damascus Gate. I visited as many holy places as possible including Church of the Holy Seprecar, Mt Olive, Milk Grotto, Western Wall, and many other places. I would spend my evenings at the Underground bar club where young Israeli soldiers would end up also. I was uncomfortable sitting there drinking a beer while everyone seemed to have weapons on them. Guns and beer dont mix well where I come from so I would not stay late at the club. After visiting so many historical sights I would also spend part of my day socializing with the Palestinians. I also visited the West Bank and departed back to Boston Massachusetts through New York on Trans World Airlines.",430

I took the train from Luxor to Aswan in first class, the train was actually nice. While in Aswan I visited the High dam, Philae Temple, and other sites. I went back to Luxor to visit the Luxor Temple, Mummification Museum, and again hang out at the Kings Head pub. After seeing all of these southern sites I went back to Cairo. I revisited the Valley of the Kings, R Mose, and Deir al Madina with the Egyptologist tourist guide Abou El Naga H Gabrail. While at the Deir al Madina I found some of the bullet holes from the terrorist attack that took place a few months before. On this visit I did notice a lot of police and undercover security everywhere around this site. It was time to go home and I money was running low, I could not afford a taxi back to the Cairo airport. A young man offered me a ride back to the airport with his horse carriage for a lower price. This was a nice ending to another fascinating trip to Egypt.

It was a beautiful day so the weather was not a factor in keeping people indoors. Most store signs showed that they opened at 400pm until the wee hours of the morning. Windsor is a gambling city so I guess the people dont come out until the evenings. The casino parking lots were full but we had no interest in going into the casinos. We drove around in different parts of the city and it all looked the same with hardly anyone in site, very odd. We drove back south and crossed the border into Michigan. <br><br>JUN1998<br>We arrived in Toronto on Trans World Airlines through St Louis Missouri.

The Porsche car factory is very small and only a few tourists are allowed at a time to visit the inside. At first the receptionist could not get me in, but I pleaded with her that I came all the way from California to see the inside of the factory. Since I was only one person she gave me a pass to go inside. I can see why the cars are so expensive as everything is made by hand and not assembled by automated machines. Even though Porsches are made in mass, the 911 models are still hand crafted. I was very glad to have seen this in person and had also seen the prototype black primered Boxster race through the parking lot. After this visit I went to see the Mercedes Benz museum, but there was no one allowed to see the cars being made. My next stop was Heidelberg where I stayed at the Hotel Garni Am Kornmarkt. This is such a nice tranquil city, I visited the castle and other various historical places. Since Heidelberg has the oldest brewery I had to go.

Our goal for this trip was to see the World Cup qualifiers, Costa Rica was playing against the United States. We didnt have tickets to the soccer match but thought to myself that no one in Oregon would bother wanting to see this game. Was I wrong, the tickets had actually sold out two hours after they went on sale. Some fans from Costa Rica actually chartered a flight to see this game. Luckily I was able to get two tickets for my Costa Rican father and myself. In the final 10 minutes USA beat Costa Rica 1-0. It was amazing to see the Civic stadium packed with hyped up fans. Since we were in Oregon we visited Blitz-Weinhard Brewery, Mt Hood, Hood River, Bridge of the Gods, Columbia River, Multnomah Falls and to the border of Washington State. Overall Oregon is an amazing beautiful and clean state. We departed Portland back to Los Angeles on Alaska Airlines",131
145,6671,"We arrived in MGA airport on Nature Air after departing San Jose Costa Rica, we spent four nights here. We visited San Juan del Sur, Esteli, Jinotega, Granada, Matagalpa, and Managua. We enjoyed a visit to Selva Negra (since 1975) a very popular tourist destination. There are no old restaurants due to the civil war that took place in the 1980s. We departed MGA airport back to LAX on Delta Airlines.<br><br>
APR2011<br>I arrived on American Airlines flying through Miami, this time I rented a 4x4 SUV to drive around the country. The bus system is great and you can go everywhere. Since it was four of us traveling renting a car made things easier. We visited Esteli, then drove over to Leon and stayed at La Perla hotel. The hotel was beautiful and luckily we had air conditioning, it is very hot and humid even at night. While driving south we stopped at Leon Viejo UNESCO world heritage site. This site is about 30 minutes south of Leon, only 1USD entrance fee. Next was Granada where we stayed at the Plaza Colonial hotel across the street from where all the horses and carriages line up to take tourists on a ride through this picturesque colonial city. After a few nights in Montelimar beach resort we headed to San Juan del Sur, still very hot and humid. We stayed at the Hotel Victoriano across the street from the beach. The weather is unbearable this time of year. Since this was Easter week all the buses were sold out to Costa Rica. We had no choice but to continue to the border and hope for some free space on the bus. Luckily some space became available and we continued south. We crossed the border at Penas Blancas on Nicabus to San Jose Costa Rica. <br><br>JUL2008<br>On American Airlines we flew through Miami to Managua. My mother is from Esteli, so I usually travel here once a year to visit family.  Collegues always ask me if it is safe, and my answer is: Why would I take my young daughter to a dangerous place.  People still think the country is at war, this happened more than 20 years ago.  The country still has a way to go in the tourist area, but its a great bargain compared to what you pay in Costa Rica.  The locals are very friendly and are always willing to help. The television show \\\\\\\'Survivor\\\\\\\' is being filmed in San Juan del Sur. After taking a taxi to the border in Penas Blancas, I rented a van on the Costa Rican side and continued with our vacation. <br><br>APR2007<br>Arrived Managua on American Airlines, this time<br>we stayed at the Hilton Princess hotel in Managua.

146,6671,"I boarded a flight in Newark NJ and flew non stop to Lima on Continental Airlines. This was the start of a 3 week trip in South America. My friend Daniel and I stayed at the Hotel Espana in Lima before getting on an AeroPeru flight to Cuzco. The city of Cuzco is a destination in itself, but our main focus was to hike the Inca trail starting from the beginning. Everyday we ate chicken and french fries as every restaurant seemed to have this on their menu. We never got tired of eating this everyday, we loved it. We joined a group of about 14 hikers with our porters who assisted in carrying all our food and tents. This would be a five day hike through the mountains, which we suffered and enjoyed. The weather changed a lot from cold to hot, you never knew what expect on the next bend. The trail was difficult but awesome, I will never forget how beautiful the mountain passes looked like. After 5 days of hiking we finally arrived at Machu Picchu. We arrived exhausted but the view from top was just incredible, well worth it. We visited the ruins after eating a simple lunch. That same night we stayed in Aguas Calientes which is below the ruins, and I had the pleasure of getting into a thermal pool. Its amazing how my aches and pains in my leg muscles went away. Hot thermal waters have healing properties. We took the train back to Cuzco the next morning. The following day we flew on Faucett Peru airlines to Juliaca and ended up in Arequipa. We took a boat from Puno on Lake Titicaca to the  Uros floating islands. Then after this adventurous boat ride we continued to Bolivia. After getting back to Lima I flew to Costa Rica on Lacsa airlines. Peru is amazing. ",174
147,6671,"We flew from London Gatwick to Ljubljana on Adria Airways. We enjoyed a three night stay at the M hotel in Ljubljana, which was about a 10 minute walk into the historical part of the city. We wondered why more tourists havent visited this country. Ljubljana is a beautiful city to walk around in and a short train ride to Bled its most popular destination. After a few days we took the train from Ljubljana to Zagreb Croatia. ",317
148,6671,"While in Panama I went the tourist route and flew on Air Panama from the PAC domestic airport in Panama city. I arrived on time at the airport but my flight was delayed for 3 hours. The flight took us on a beautiful route over the islands where we landed at Corazon de Jesus. I spent a few hours here before I was transported to Tiger Island were I spent one night. A very small island were I was the only tourist amongst all the locals. The beachfront hut was only $10 per night. There is not much to do here except sleep, lay out in the sun, snorkel, and hang around with the locals. They should rename the island Zero Stress. The local cuisine I had was very good and different from what they serve on the mainland. The two young females that worked here were always ready to cook whatever I was in the mood for. Some people that visit this area are Western retirees who will spend months here on their yachts. I recommend two nights in San Blas, unless you are planning on going from one island to the next, which there are many. On my 2nd night I went back by boat to Corozan de Jesus. I spent the night at Restaurante Nali’s Café where the owner rents rooms in her home. From Corozan de Jesus you walk across the bridge and you are now in Nargana where Nalis is located. I had breakfast at Nali's Cafe and waited for my flight back to Panama City, and yes it was late again going back. While waiting to board the airplane at the Corozan de Jesus airstrip the sand fleas attacked us all, even though we had a lot of repelant on us.",162
149,6671,"We drove in from Vancouver British Columbia to Seattle. We stayed two nights at the Vance Hotel located right in the city. Since we love coffee we had to visit the first Starbucks and also Pike Place Market. Seattle has to have the highest concentration of coffee houses, there seems to be one on every block. I left the rental car in the parking lot and used public transportation to get everywhere in the city. We also took the monorail to the Space Needle. We drove back to Vancouver British Columbia.",148
150,6671,Flew nonstop on Alaska Airlines from LAX to Vancouver. We spent a few nights at the Four Seasons hotel and visited the various sites around the city. The weather was gloomy but we drove to Stanley Park and Granville Island. I always stop at micobreweries so I had some beer at the Granville Island brewery. From Vancouver we drove down to Seattle Washington and spent a few nights there. We then drove back to Vancouver to catch our flight back to LAX on Alaska Airlines.  ,88
151,6671,"JUN2002<br>This time we flew on American Trans Air to Maui and stayed at the Maui Lu hotel (since 1954) which needs to be completely renovated. This place has seen better days. We joined the Mountain Riders Bike Tour which started from the summit of Haleakala. It was a 38 mile ride down the mountain to the sea. For a very beautiful sterilized island vacation Hawaii is the place to be. I have visited Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the big island of Hawaii.<br><br>JUN2000<br>We flew from LAX to Kona on Trans World Airlines.<br>I found a great deal at the Kona Surf Resort due in fact that the hotel was about to close for renovations. I love coffee so we visited the Greenwell Coffee Farm and purchased some expensive coffee, it was worth it. Since this island has an active volcano we visited the Volcanoes National Park. The highway was blocked by the lava flow. In Kahaluu there is St Peters catholic church probably one of the smallest churches Ive been to, it is located on the beach. Since Kona has a microbrewery called Mehana I had to pay a visit and sample some of their premium beer. After four nights we flew back to LAX on Trans World Airlines. <br><br>JUL1997<br>We flew on United Airlines from LAX to Honolulu then connected on Aloha Airlines to Lihue Kauai.<br>Stayed at a very nice timeshare and went to all the local tourist sites.

We flew back to Honolulu on Aloha Airlines and continued our island adventure. We stayed at one of the many high rise Outrigger hotels. Went to the Honolulu Flea Market, Dole Plantation, USS Arizona memorial, Germaines Luau and many of its beaches. After a few days we flew back to LAX on United Airlines.",21
152,6671,"Our group flew from LAX to Brussels on Delta airlines. This was a company fam and the best type of trips because everything is paid for. We stayed at the Conrad Hilton and had a nice luxurious stay. We went on a walking tour and was able to see all the highlights including the famous Manneken Pis. The tourist board took us to some extraodinary restaurants were the food was absolutely delicious. Since I was well fed I was not able to try the famous waffles out of the Volkswagen kombi vans parked around the city. As everyone knows Belgium is famous for beer and we visited the Cantillon brewery to try their seasonal beer. I did not like this bitter beer, I would of rather tried their regular beers. One night we had dinner at Chez Leon open since 1893, the food and atmosphere was excellent. Finding wine made in Belgium is rare, I was lucky to find a few bottles and bring them back home. On our departure we flew back on Delta Airlines from Brussels through Atlanta Georgia into LAX airport. ",800
153,6671,"I departed Tucuman province and arrived by bus to Rio Hondo with thoughts of spending one night here. Its a sleepy town with hardly anybody on the streets. When I arrived I was the only foreign tourist in the area, this area caters to local Argentinians. I wanted to try their hot thermal waters which most of the family run hotels offer, but decided to continue on my journey. There are a lot of restaurants offering local cuisine which are next to the park plaza, a good option if you are planning a quick layover. This is where I found all the local tourists, everybody seemed to be here for the local cuisine. After a delicious lunch I took the collectivo to Santiago de Estero and was again the only foreign tourist around, actually the only person around. It was seista time so the city was almost deserted. Since I was here I decided to walk around the town and find the main plaza. Two hours was all it took for me to decide this small city has nothing to offer a  tourist a reason to stay, except one more point on MTP. I went back to the bus station and continued to Catamarca.",771
154,6671,"I participated in a Jamaica Tourist Board fam for a 4 night trip. This is to familiarize ourselves with the latest resorts around Montego Bay and Negril. I flew roundtrip with Delta Airlines from Atlanta GA to MBJ airport. I stayed at Iberostar Rose Hall Beach, RIU Palace Tropical Bay, and Iberostar Rose Hall Grand resorts. These all inclusive beach resorts are very nice but it is not the type of experience I like to receive from a destination. After a few days at these mega resorts I felt trapped because they are always far away from the true island experience. These resorts are for tourists who want to eat, sleep, drink and lay out at the beach without getting any real island culture. We did go on an excursion to visit Ricks Cafe (since 1974) in Negril, which I jumped from the same cliff on my last visit.<BR><BR>
MAR2000<BR>
We flew on Trans World Airlines from LAX connecting in St Louis and landed at MBJ airport. We stayed near Rose Hall at the Hotel Gloriana. The town or city of Montego Bay is not a really nice place to visit. Most tourists stay enclosed in their resorts and really dont venture out, so they never see the real Jamaica. When we needed a ride we always flagged down a local citizen and hitched a ride into town for a $1 each. Across the street from the post office there is a cafe that serves probably the best coffee in the world. We love coffee and we always visit coffee plantations and this little cafe is one that I will always remember. Blue Mountain is top quality and thats what they served us here. One of the main attractions here is Dunns river falls where thousands of tourists come to walk and destroy the natural beauty of this location. One day we went to Negril and visited Ricks Cafe which is on a bluff. After a few drinks many tourists will jump off the high cliff into the ocean below, I ended up being one of them. One too many Red Stripe beers gave me the courage. The main reason we came to Jamaica was to go to Cuba, so after spending five days here, off we flew to Havana on Air Jamaica.",199
155,6671,"Driving in from Arizona we first passed Las Cruces and headed for Roswell. Ive always wanted to see Roswell for its UFO factor. Its a long drive and not worth it unless you are an UFO fanatic. The town of Roswell doesnt offer much, except for a few UFO stores and a McDonalds that has a UFO on it. We spent one night at the Hampton Inn Suites in Roswell then continued North to Santa Fe. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya in Santa Ana Pueblo and visited both Santa Fe and Albuquerque. We continued our trip by driving back west into Arizona.",120
156,6671,"From Milan I flew to Rome on Alitalia Airlines. I started here to continue my adventure to Naples and came back to Rome. I returned to Hotel Sandy which is actually a hostel on Via Cavour. On this vacation I stopped to have coffee at the Caffe Greco established in 1760. I went to revisit the usual popular places such as the Spanish steps, Fountain de Trevi, Pantheon, Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II, and the Vatican. When I left I went to the Rome Termini and took the train to FCO airport. Since I worked for TWA airlines I was lucky and got first class to New York JFK airport. <br><br><br><br>MAR1994<br>This was the first place I visited when I first visited Europe. Since I worked for Trans World Airlines I flew first class to Rome. I spent 3 weeks visiting every possible historic place in the area. I went to so many churches I would never be able to remember all their names. This city will always be in my mind since it was the first place I visited in Europe and got me addicted to traveling. I used Rome as my base and took side trips by train to Naples Campania and Venice Veneto. Since I was in Rome I took the short bus ride to the Vatican City. ",899
157,6671,"We departed Iguassu Falls in Parana State Brazil on Lapa Airlines. This flight took us to AEP Buenos Aires then connected to Pluna Airlines where we flew to Montevideo Uruguay. We stayed at the hotel Mediterraneo for two nights. We joined a day tour to see all of the popular places around Montevideo. The bus was full of travel agents from Costa Rica who were on a fam. Our stops included parts of the city, Casa Pueblo artist Carlos Paez Vilaro home, and Punta del Este. Since this was considered off season, Punta del Este was eerily empty. On our departure we took a bus to Colonia and spent the day in this colonial city. After our full day here we took the Buquebus ferry to Buenos Aires Argentina. ",177
158,6671,We departed from Ciudad del Este Paraguay by crossing the Friendship bridge by bus to see Iguazu falls. We started in the morning since we were only going to spend the full day here. We took a taxi after crossing the bridge and where pulled over by the police. I thought they were going to ask for a bribe but they actually thought they had seen us enter the country illegaly. They let us go and we continued to Iguazu. We enjoyed the falls and walked along its many pathways and also visited the Argentinian side. After our visit we took a flight with Lapa Airlines to AEP airport in Argentina and then connected to Pluna Airlines to Montevideo Uruguay.,590
159,6671,"We flew from Sao Paulo Brazil into Asuncion on Varig Airlines. I had a taxi driver take us to a hotel that I had in mind. When we arrived the hotel was out of business, so we stayed nearby at the Sagaro hotel. We like coffee so I read about a nice coffee shop nearby, when we arrived it was also out of business. I couldnt believe how many businesses seemed to be closed due to the bad economy in the country. In a way this was a good thing as our US dollars took us a long way on a spending spree. We purchased a lot of carved wooden saints that we mailed back to the USA. Our next bus ride was to Cuidad del Este where we spent one night at the Gran Hotel Convair. This is not an attractive city but a place where a lot of goods are sold and smuggled. There are many Lebonese people that live here so we went to a restaurant called Lebanon to have dinner. The next morning we crossed the Friendship bridge over to Parana Brazil to go see Iguazu falls.",173

The rooftop of the hotel had a fantastic view of the Copacabana beach. Many people told us that Rio was unsafe and we should not go. We had a great time in the city and never felt unsafe. We went to all the popular tourist destinations that included Christ the redeemer and Sugarloaf mountain. We took the bus along the Costa Verde to Paraty. Our hotel was the Solar dos Geranios a rustic colonial family home. This was a nice town where when the tide rises it partially floods the cobble stone streets. The town is well known for its puppets and we went to an adult evening show at the Espaco theatre. We departed Paraty by bus and went to Sao Paulo.  ,593
163,6671,"We departed Muscat Oman on Qatar Airways and flew into DOH airport. We stayed two nights at the Marriott Doha. The hotel was very nice but the pool was closed for renovation. We could of used a swimming pool since it was so hot and humid, even in the evening. If you are in the area, stop by for a visit. The country doesnt have a lot to offer. The skyline is growing with its high rises as this country is trying to get a slice of the Dubai pie. Since the roads are easy to navigate I rented a car and was able to see everything. Dont go during Ramadan as you will be sitting around all day with nothing to do - everything is closed. A two day stay will be sufficient to see what little Doha has to offer. We departed Doha on British Airways on a short flight to Bahrain. ",435
164,6671,"I flew on Iceland airlines to visit Reykjavík over the weekend.  The flight departed from Washington Dulles airport and we arrived early in the morning in Reykjavik where I took the airport bus into the city. The sky looked very eerie with the colorful clouds above. I expected everything to be very expensive, but it wasnt as bad as I thought. I spent two nights at the Hilton Reykjavik Nordica about a 15 minute walk into the center of the city. This time of year the weather was kind of chilly, but you never knew what to expect. The sky would be clear and an hour later it would be windy with snow flurries. I ate a few times at a tiny hot dog stand called Bæjarins beztu pylsur. The food was really good, President Clinton has also eaten here. The cold weekend night did not stop any of the locals or tourists from going out and partying all night at the clubs. Before leaving for the airport I had to do what most visitors do and enjoyed my free time at the Blue Lagoon. After relaxing for many hours at these thermal waters I flew back to New York JFK airport.",230
165,6671,Departed Pamplona Navarre to Barcelona by train. I meet an Aussie at the train station and we ended up going to a pension near the ramblas. Some other Aussies were staying there so we all hung out together and visited the many sights in this fantastic city. The main attractions that we visited were the Temple de la Sagrada Familia and going over to Montserrat. One thing I could not believe was all the graffiti inside La Sagrada Familia. In the United States this is considered a felony for defacing any religious property. After a few nights here I flew back to Paris Centre France on Air France. ,250
166,6671,"Departed Madrid on an overnight train to get to Pamplona Navarre. I will never forget this train ride which I shared a cabin with some girls from California and some guys from South Africa. Everyone was heading to Pamplona for the San Fermin festival or as we call it the Running of the Bulls. We had some unexpected guests come into our cabin in the form of young gypsies who hid under the seats. They were hiding because they had no tickets and the ticket takers would throw them off the train. The rail employees ended up catching some of the gypsies and taking them off the train. The gypsies were slick, all they did was run to the next car and get back on the train again. When I arrived in Pamplona the city was very crowded, I ended up sleeping in a huge attic converted into sleeping quarters. It was full of sleeping bags like a giant sleep over. Many other young tourists slept on the streets or parks overnight, it was that crowded. I was to meet my friend from Washington DC here but we never ended up finding each other. This was one big street festival that seemed to never stop day or night. I ended up spending some time helping a young local couple sell sandwiches out of there shop to all the masses. They never knew how big this festival really is, I told them they show it on television every year in Los Angeles. They were suprised by this and didnt know how far the news their festival reached around the world. Everyday I would go watch the bulls run through the small streets but never participated with the runners. After seeing bulls running over some runners everyday I didnt want to take a risk and get run over by these cars on four legs. After my adventure here I said good bye to my new friends and took the train to Barcelona Catalona. ",844
167,6671,"When we left Belfast North Ireland we traveled by train to Dublin, a very nice ride with great coastal views. We spent two nights at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin, a very nice and modern hotel within walking distance to the heart of the city. Dublin is easy to navigate and get to the main tourist spots. We liked the city, but one thing we didnt like is that nothing was free. I felt this was the most expensive place Ive been to, even more expensive than London. All the churches charge entrance fees. I saw many Spaniards and Italians turn away because they couldnt believe churches were charging entrance fees. We walked to the Guiness beer factory and they also charge an entrance fee. I have never paid an entrance fee to a brewery, so I didnt go inside. Instead we walked to the Brazen Head pub which is the oldest bar in Dublin est. 1198 and drank some Guiness beer. We departed Dublin and flew to Isle of Man on Aer Arann. ",275
168,6671,"We crossed the border from Los Manos Nicaragua into Honduras. Our first stop was El Paraiso where we spent the night at Hotel La Esperanza. We continued the next day to Danli then on to the capital Tegucigalpa. Central America has great bus service to anywhere you can think of, so this made it easy to move around from city to city. My mother and I did not like this city so we decided not to stay and continue south to El Amatillo and crossed the border here into El Salvador. ",159
169,6671,"I boarded a train from Rome to Salerno and made my way through the Amalfi coast by public bus. This was off season and I felt like I had the coast to myself, hardly any tourists were here.<br>I spent one night in Sorrento at the Ostello Della Sirene and paid in Italian Lira. The weather was nice and enjoyed the hospitality of the locals. I visited Amalfi, Sorrento, Positano, Ravello, and Capri. Parking space is very limited here, so owning an automobile is probably more hassle than its worth. I bought locally made ceramic tile and tried the limoncello liquor that everyone seems to sell. The sunsets were beautiful here and couldnt believe the locals didnt bother to stand still for a moment and watch this spectacle. I guess they are used to seeing these beautiful sunsets everyday. When I left I took the bus to Napoli Centrale rail station, from here I went to Rome in Lazio. <br><br>MAR1994 <br>I bought a train ticket from Rome termini to Pompei Campania and paid for it in Italian Lira. This was a day trip since I really wanted to see the ruins. After my day long visit I took the train back to Rome. ",896
170,6671,"We left Durango on an eight hour bus ride through the magnificent mountain range to reach Mazatlan Sinaloa. We finally arrived to the city and had a taxi take us to the Hotel Belmar (since 1924). The hotel has seen better days but it is located in Old Mazatlan at Playa Olas Altas. At the next block over we had dinner at El Shrimp Bucket (since 1963), good seafood at reasonable prices. Many locals cruise the old street Olas Altas and many American tourists enjoy the ocean breezes while enjoying their cocktails. After the noise settled down in the evening I was able to sleep with the sound of crashing waves outside our hotel. The next morning we walked through the deserted historic Plazuela Machado and to the Central Market. There are many restaurants on the 2nd floor of the Pino Suarez Central Market (since 1899) which serves great food upstairs at low prices. Later in the afternoon we flew back to LAX on Alaska Airlines.

172,6671,"We were on an overnight bus from Lazaro Cardenas Michoacan which took us 8 hours to arrive in Manzanillo. During the dark early morning we were awaken by soldiers at a security check point. There are many of these checkpoints throughout Mexico because of the on going drug violence. When we arrived at the bus station we took a taxi to the Hotel Colonial in the heart of the old city. Because it was Independence day some roads were blocked for the parade route. I didnt see any foreign tourist in this part of the city as most of them stay in the hoteleria beach zone about a half hour away by collectivo. The old city is a nice tranquil place to be and there are many good restaurants serving delicious meals. We visited all the main sites of the old city and went to the Iguanario Archundia which raises endangered species. There are hundreds of iguanas, turtles and racoons that are being raised here. On our second day we went to the hoteleria zone and visited Las Hadas resort one of the most popular hotels in Manzanillo. This area of the city has all the fast food restaurants, Starbucks and mega-stores that cater to the locals and tourists. The old city has more character than the beach hotel zone. Two nights were enough and we took a morning bus to our next destination Puerto Vallarta Jalisco. ",651
173,6671,We crossed the border from El Amatillo Honduras into El Salvador. We took the bus to San Miguel were we spent part of the day here. This is a small town that reminded me of other parts of Central America. My mother and I enjoyed lunch here and continued on our way back to the El Amatillo Honduras border and back into Nicaragua. ,157
174,6671,I picked up a rental car from the PVR airport in Jalisco. We had been invited to a site inspection of the St Regis and Four Seasons hotels in Punta de Mita. It took us about an hour to drive here from Puerto Vallarta. The private entrance to the resorts are not well marked as most guests arrive by chauffered SUVs. I had not eaten all day because we also were invited to lunch at both properties. The hotels are an excellent place for a getaway if you have the money to spend on luxury. The lunches they provided were excellent and I had my fill of seafood at both properties. After our visit we drove to Sayulita about a twenty minute drive away. Sayulita is a surfers paradise and is filled with Californians as I noticed vehicles with California license plates around the town. After our brief visit in this tranquil place we drove back to Puerto Vallarta Jalisco to drop off the rental car. ,661
175,6671,"We took a morning bus from Manzanillo Colima into the old city of Puerto Vallarta. Luckily our hotel was walking distance from the bus stop. We booked two nights at Casa Dona Susana hotel in the heart of the old city. Lots of coffee shops, restaurants, souvenir shops and bars are found lining the cobble stoned streets. This is a nice place to be and you can try many of the great restaurants around the city. Everywhere I ate the food was great. One drawback is the humidity which you feel as soon as you leave your air conditioned room. I went to the airport to pick up a rental car so we could drive over to Punta de Mita in Nayarit. After our two night stay in this enjoyable city we flew back on Alaska Airlines to LAX. ",656
176,6671,We arrived from Zihuatanejo Guerrero to Lazaro Cardenas by bus. I did not plan on spending the night here but just wanted to visit for the day. We took a collectivo to Playa Azul about an hour away this is the most popular beach area for the locals. Playa Azul is a sleepy beach village but has a lot of restaurants lining its shore. We seemed to be the only foreign tourists walking around here actually there was hardly anyone around. We had lunch at one of the restaurants and had a fried fish plate for only 40 MXN pesos. There is not much to do here except relax or go surfing like some of the locals were doing. After lunch we went back to Lazaro Cardenas and took an overnight bus to Manzanillo Colima.  ,659
177,6671,"We left Mexico DF on Costa bus lines to Cuernavaca. It only takes about an hour to get here. I had booked one night at the Hotel Roma which is walking distance to the city center. There are many family run hotels in the city center, so there is no need to book in advance. When we first arrived we took a collectivo bus to get to the ruins of Xochicalco a UNESCO site. It took us about an hour to get there with the bus and taxi connections. The museum is nice and the ruins are partially original where you can see that most of it has been restored. Its worth taking the time to go see these ruins. When we arrived back to the city center the plaza area was filled with locals enjoying the street entertainment. We walked over to see the most famous hotel and restaurant in the area called Las Mananitas. This place serves the upper crust and is both beautiful and expensive in local terms. The museums were closed so we were not able to see them. We went to probably the oldest restaurant in the city called India Linda (since 1933). We were the only customers in this pleasant garden restaurant and we seemed to be the only foreign tourist in the city itself. The next morning we took the bus to our next destination Acapulco Guerrero.",660
178,6671,"After traveling around Turkey we flew on Lufthansa Airlines from Istanbul to Detroit via Frankfurt. We had never been to Michigan and we only planned on spending one night so we could visit downtown Detroit. I booked the Marriott Detroit Airport hotel and asked the front desk agent where I can catch the bus or metro into the city. He asked why would I want to go into the city and that there is no public transportation into the city from the airport. I found this odd since most major cities have transportation from the airport. I ignored his plea not to bother going into the city. Instead I rented a car and we drove into Detroit. Once we arrived in the city  I realized why the front desk agent told me this. Poor Detroit was abandoned with many stores boarded up and not even a Starbucks to go have some coffee. I kept driving around the city hoping to find an area that had some life to it, but it was hopeless. It was a nice sunny day and we didnt really know what to go see or do since we encountered this delapitated city. Our flight wasnt leaving until 715pm so I decided to drive north into Windsor Canada. On our drive north we stopped in a place called Mexicantown which happened to have a lot of Mexican restaurants. We decided to have lunch at El Zocalo restaurant before we crossed the border. They advertise \'like being at the finest of Mexico City\', the food was just okay. We crossed the border into Ontario for our day trip and drove back into Michigan. After our disappointing city tour we departed DTW airport back to LAX on NorthWest Airlines.",110
179,6671,"We departed Athens Greece on Turkish Airlines into Istanbul. We would spend two nights at the Pera Palace (since 1892) which was Agatha Christies favorite hotel in Istanbul. We ate at the Pudding Shop (since 1957) made famous in the movie Midnight Express. We departed on Turkish Airlines back to Los Angeles two days before the terrorists attacked the airport.<br><br>
JUN2013<br>
We departed Varna Bulgaria on an overnight luxury bus to Istanbul. We spent two nights at the Ilkay Hotel in the Sultanahmet area. Despite the political protest in the Taksim area, there were many tourists in the old city. We visited UNESCO Hagia Sophia, UNESCO Hippodrome of Constantine, UNESCO Suleymaniye Mosque, Grand Bazaar, and Basilica Cistern. We took a day trip by ferry to Kadikoy Anatolia which only cost 3TL each way. We departed Istanbul back to LAX on Lufthansa Airlines transfering in Munich Germany.<br><br>
MAR2002<br>
We arrived on Lufthansa airlines from Frankfurt into IST airport. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton hotel for three nights and had a nice view of the Bosphorus and football stadium below. This was a convenient location where we visited the most popular sites such as Taksim square, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the fun Grand Bazaar. This is one of the best bazaars I have visited where the sellers dont harass you. Four Seasons Istanbul at Sultanahmet was also on our list of places to visit, this hotel was a former prison. We also went to the Ciragan Palace hotel on the Bosphorus and took a boat ride too. We then departed Istanbul with Turkish Airlines and flew to Ankara in Anatolia. We returned to Istanbul and stayed at the Ritz Carlton again. On this visit we went to Cemberlitas Bath an old turkish bath house. I wanted a traditional hammam bath, it was an okay experience. A nice experience was a visit to the underground cistern, and the many restaurants we ate at. After two nights we flew from Istanbul to Detroit Michigan with Lufthansa Airlines.",325
180,6671,"Departed from Istanbul by ferry to Kadikoy for only 3TL each way. These waters are very busy with boats and cargo ships going through the Golden Horn. This was to be a quick day trip to the Asian side of Turkey. We ate some spinash and cheese gozleme at a local restaurant. After our short visit we went back to the ferry port to go back to Istanbul.<br><br> 
MAR2002<br>
Flew in from Istanbul airport into Ankara with Turkish Airlines. We stayed inside the old citadel at the Angora House hotel. Our taxi driver didnt know where this was located but he eventually got directions to this location. This is the old part of city and was convenient to all the usual places we like to visit like the museum. I bought a lot of hand made copper goods here in Ankara. After two nights we flew back with Turkish Airlines to Istanbul.",556
181,6671,"I was able to get a discount ticket on Lufthansa airlines from LAX and we flew into Berlin through Frankfurt. On the first part of this trip we spent the night at the Courtyard by Marriott Berlin Teltow. We left Berlin to go to Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony and returned to Berlin. This time we spent two nights at the number one hotel in Berlin, the beautiful Regent Schlosshotel in their suite Solitude. It was more of a mansion than a hotel. Cant be in Berlin without visiting checkpoint Charlie and the wall or whats left of it. We also went to the MauerMuseum next door to the checkpoint. Since we had a rental car we drove to Potsdam in Brandenburg. After our two nights here we flew from Berlin through Frankfurt on our way to Istanbul Turkey on Lufthansa Airlines. ",805
182,6671,"From Berlin we drove through Saxony Anhalt into Lower Saxony. My favorite automobile is Volkswagen so I made plans to visit the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg. We spent the night at the Tryp Wolfsburg hotel and off I went to the factory. The Autostadt Wolfsburg is a huge facility housing everything VW, old and new. I am more interested in the old so I took many photos of the split window beetles and barn door kombis. For a VW fanatic this place is heaven. I also visited the AutoMuseum Volkswagen which has a nice collection of antique VWs and rare models. The next day we drove back to Berlin. ",810
183,6671,While we were in Berlin we drove to Potsdam in our rental car. The main attraction here is Sanssouci a residence built by King Frederick the Great in 1744. After our half day visit here we went back to Berlin.,806
184,6671,"On 06SEP we took a short flight from Bahrain to Kuwait on Gulf Air.<br>We visited Kuwait during Ramadan which is not a good time to go, because mostly everything is closed.  We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton which is a great hotel, they even pick you up at the airport in their fancy MBenz SUV. We asked the front desk clerk how many tourists are staying here, he said we were it. No tourists are here only United States government workers. The Sheraton hotel next door was used as the Iraqi military headquarters during the invasion. We asked the concierge at the hotel to check on the museum hours because of Ramadan. We had a driver take us to the Al-Qurain Martyrs museum the next day as it was open until noon. When we arrived it was closed, the driver spoke to the attendant on duty. I told our driver to tell the attendant we are tourists from the United States and this is the only chance we have to see the museum. They opened the museum for us but only gave us 30 minutes to look around. We were very thankful that they let us in. Once inside this home one could just feel how much chaos must have occured during this attack. Its very sad to see. Another museum we visited was the Kuwait House of National Memorial. When we arrived it was also closed, but they let us in. This museum shows the horrors of the Iraqi invasion. Failaka Island was on our list of places to see, we took the ferry over on a bumpy sea. There is not much to see here, so I dont recommend it. Its best to visit during local holidays when the place has more to offer. The concierge at the Sheraton Hotel gave me a bunch of free postcards of Kuwait. When I went to the post office to get stamps, they were closed because of a major water leak. I told one of the employees that I need the stamps now since we leave for the United States early tomorrow morning. They opened up the office so I could purchase the stamps. The Kuwaitis are very hospitable and most are wealthy, but I wish they would extend some funds for cleaning up their city. The hotels and fancy malls are very nice, but once you step outside you are in a dirty third world country. On 09SEP we flew from Kuwait to Washington Dulles airport on United Airlines then home to Los Angeles. ",432
185,6671,"Our flight from Palermo to Tunis went without any problems. On arrival at the Tunis airport everything was fine until it started raining.<br>We were in a taxi going to our resort hotel Sheraton Hammamet. This was no ordinary rain, it rained so hard that the streets and highways started flooding and our taxi driver did not want to continue. He dropped us off at the Tunis train station and we waited around like everyone else. No taxis no trains nothing was available and moving, we waited 8 hours here. I called my friend Walid who lives here in Tunis and asked him to pick us up and take us to the Sheraton hotel in Hammamet. We went into the city after the waters resided and we ate and drank at a sidewalk cafe. Later that evening a taxi finally got us to the hotel. We enjoyed Hammamet, Sousse, Carthage and Sidi Bou Said with all its blue doors. We spent a total of 5 days here, cant wait to go back someday. We flew out of Tunis on TunisAir to Nice France.",414
186,6671,"We drove north from Dubai to Al Darah to cross the border into Tibat Ras Musandam. It only took about a half an hour to cross the border and cost $40USD for the visa. Once we entered we drove along the coast with its sheer cliffs above us. The town of Khasab was deserted, hardly anyone was on the street. As for tourist, we were it nobody was here except us three lonely travelers. Dont go during the holy month of Ramadan, mostly everything will be closed. Because everything was closed we only spent a couple of hours here. If you plan on staying here one or two nights would be sufficient. At the border I had asked the customs agent if I was allowed to drive a loop and exit through Dibba on the east coast back to the UAE. He advised me not to drive this route unless I had a 4x4 vehicle, so I took his advise and returned through Tibat. I would not want to get stuck on some desert road during the hot month of August.",437
187,6671,"I drove into RAK in my rental car from Umm Al Quwain. This Emirate has grown considerably since I was here five years ago, they are trying to get piece of the successful Dubai pie. There are many new buildings, malls, and beach resort hotels being built. I went to the museum and the mall then drove back south to Sharjah.<br><br>
AUG2008<br>
We drove north from Umm al Quwain into Ras Al Khaimah. This small emirate doesnt offer a lot for a tourist. But since I had a rental car we drove to all the emirates on the western part of the UAE. We did locate the National Museum of Ras Al Khaimah, we were the only tourist here. It was nice to be inside the museum, since it was so hot and humid outside. After our visit here we continued driving north to Al Darah to cross the border into Tibat Musandam Oman.",436
188,6671,"Departed Sharjah in my rental car to visit Ajman and all the northern Emirates. There is not much to see here except for the museum. It was nice to be indoors as it was very hot and humid outside. I was the only tourist at the museum, not many tourists bother to come here. My next stop was Umm Al Quwain.<br><br>
AUG2008<br>
We rented a car from the Dubai airport to go visit the rest of the Emirates. We drove north from Sharjah into Ajman. Locating Ajman was not easy as we didnt see any signs stating we were entering the area. So we drove to the Ajman mall, and then we knew for a fact we were in Ajman. Despite the mall there is not much to see here. We continued our drive north to Umm Al Quwain.",422
189,6671,"I drove from Ajman into UAQ in my rental car always with the air conditioner on, it was so hot. Nothing much has happened here since 2008 when I last visited the area. I stopped by the museum which was closed and then to the post office. This sleepy Emirate does not offer a tourist a reason to spend more than two hours here. I continued my drive north to Ras Al Khaimah.<br><br>
AUG2008<br>
Leaving Ajman we continued north to Umm Al Qaiwain. This Emirate during the summer can get very hot and humid. The museum had see through plastic doors to keep the cold air inside. We were the only ones at the museum besides a film crew. The film crew requested our assistance in being in their film for a tourist video on the Emirates. The museum has many interesting displays but thats about the only place of importance in this small emirate. We continued driving north to Ras Al Khaimah.",441
190,6671,"I flew on Austral Lineas Aereas from Buenos Aires AEP domestic airport to Jujuy Airport. The airport here is very small and you have to use the stairs to get off the airplane. I took a shared taxi into the city, since there was no bus service close to the airport. I stayed one night at the Hostal Yokwahi. There are thermal waters about 40 minutes north of the city, these waters are very hot. The city doesnt offer too much for the tourist but there is a UNESCO world heritage site about 2 hours north toward Bolivia. I did not have the time to go visit this WHS. I ate local cuisine at the Viracocha cosina regional restaurant. The food was very good with great ambiance and locals playing their guitars while having dinner. The next day I continued on my journey by bus south to Salta Province. ",759

192,6671,"We drove our red Ford Mustang rental car from Cheyenne Wyoming east to the very sleepy town of Kimball. This is a small town and it does have a small museum but it was closed. We shopped in the few stores along Chestnut Street, but not much happens here. There was a gift shop we went into and we would probably be its only customers all day. Yes, thats how sleepy this town is. We took a break at the towns Dairy Queen and had some ice cream. After this brief stop we headed south back into Colorado. ",115
193,6671,From Denver Colorado we drove our red Ford Mustang rental car into Cheyenne. We spent part of the day visiting Cheyenne city center and the museum. It's a small capital so you can see most of it in one day. The people are friendly and city is very tranquil. I really enjoyed it here during the nice summer weather. After our visit we drove east into Nebraska. ,151
194,6671,"We had a rental car so we explored as many places as time allowed. After dropping off our daughter in Leeds for the 100th anniversary celebration of the Girl Guides we drove north to Scotland. I booked two nights at the Radisson Blu hotel. Edinburgh was a delite, we loved this city and all that it had to offer. One disappointing fact facing Edinburgh is all the tourist trap souvenir shops that are everywhere. I like buying postcards but the souvenir shops here were overwhelming. We took a local bus to go see Rosslyn Chapel which is nearby in the village of Roslin. We arrived just before closing but were able to see the interior, the outside had scaffolding. Our next stop was to the north in Inverness, a lot of tourists come here to either go to Loch Ness or the Orkney Islands. I booked two nights at the Ramada Encore hotel a one minute walk to the bus station. I didnt think this area received a lot of tourists but our hotel was packed. Inverness is small so everything was walking distance from our hotel. We had booked a day tour to Orkney Island and our tour started at the bus station. We also visited Glasgow and also enjoyed this city. Our goal for being in Glasgow was to stop in Lockerbie to see the memorial for the Pan Am Airlines terrorist attack on 21DEC88. We continued our drive south and drove into Cardiff Wales. ",312

From a bus stop I jumped in a taxi that took me to the YMCA where I got a room for $20USD. One thing I have to say about the taxis in Nairobi, they ought to junk them all. The taxis here are falling apart and should be replaced. I regret I only spent one night here and didnt get to enjoy the city of Nairobi. I went to the NBO airport and took a flight back on Egypt Air to Cairo. ",383
196,6671,"Found my way to Dar es Salaam from Cairo Egypt on Egypt Airlines in business class. I had met a New York teacher on the flight who goes here every time she is on vacation to stay in Tanzania and teach school children English. I took a taxi with her into the city since she knew the area very well. I stayed at the Luther House for a couple of days until I meet up with my friend from Washington DC so we could climb Mt Kilimanjaro. I had met a local who showed me around DAR while I waited, its a poor country with lots of character. Since I had arrived a week before the climb, I decided to take a ferry to Zanzibar. When I got back to DAR, we took the microbus to Marangu Kilimanjaro where we stayed at the Babylon Lodge. This is where we meet our guides and got our supplies in the local central market.  We did the climb up the mountain, not easy at all. We spent five days climbing this mountain in this cold snowy weather. One day I was walking around outside in shorts and flip flop sandals while it was snowing and the Europeans couldnt believe I wasnt cold, I guess my body got a little used to this weather. I dont like climbing mountains and this was very difficult with the thin air and the very cold weather. We made it, but I found out the following month that 13 climbers had died. When we left Kilimanjaro I headed back to DAR then to Arusha to continue my journey by bus to Kenya. ",412
197,6671,"While in Dar es Salaam I asked my local guide how I can get to Zanzibar. We walked over to the docks and I went with Azam Marine ferryboat service, I paid for my ticket and he got his commission. I stayed at the Haven Guest House in the middle of Stonetown. Im glad I decided to go, I enjoyed Stonetown and its beautiful carved doors and good food. The few things I did were hang out at the The Africa House Hotel bar, the spice tour, Palace Museum, prison island to see the huge turtles and drank plenty of Safari Lager beer. Also the island is famous for the red Columbus monkeys that are in the Jozani forest. I became friends with Walid from Tunisia here and we still keep in touch after all these years. After a few nights here I took the ferry back to Dar es Salaam so my friend and I could climb Mt Kilimanjaro.",419
198,6671,"Since I was in Rome just like any other tourist I went to visit the Holy See. Passed Saint Peter\'s Square to enter the huge church, this was off season so there was no line to go inside. I still cannot believe that people would actually vandalize the top of the church with their graffiti. You dont see this in America as it is a felony to vandalize any church. Also spent some time in the Vatican museum, seen the Sistene chapel and went to the Vatican post office. I mailed a lot of Pope John Paul II postcards from here to my Catholic family, to them its a big gift to receive something straight from the Vatican.  This post office is very popular as many tourist want to collect these stamps and send postcards from the holiest Catholic place in Europe.<br><br>
MAR1994<br>While in Rome I took bus 64 over to the Vatican, you have to be careful on this bus since there are many pick pockets waiting to prey on tourists. I went to see the Sistene Chapel and also visited the Vatican post office.",327

Since we didnt have a lot of money in those days we stayed in a converted basement turned apartment. It was centrally located where we were able to walk to everything. We visited the main tourist sites, river cruise, churches, Anne Franks house, Van Gogh museum, and the Heineken factory. We had a great time at the factory where they continued to pour the beer and all for free. This beer hall was the best of any of the breweries I have been to worldwide. We stopped at many of the coffee houses like The Greenhouse Effect and Kadinksy. After five days of fun with coworkers I flew to London to meet up with some family members. ",301

There are many buses that leave DF for Teotihuacan. This is special place and should not be missed, plan on spending a full day touring this location. Teotihuacan is the most popular tourist attraction in the state of Mexico. There is a lot of walking to do, so be prepared with good walking shoes and a sun hat. After touring the area we walked to the famous La Gruta restaurant (since 1906) just outside from the site. The cave restaurant itself is a site to behold. The climate stays cool inside while you enjoy delicious food at a price. After lunch we went back to Mexico DF by bus.",657
201,6671,"We went on a day trip from Mexico DF by bus to Tlaxcala. The bus service in Mexico is excellent, the best I've encontered anywhere in the world. There are frequent buses that go on this route. Tlaxcala is a nice quiet place to visit, plenty of restaurants with great food. There is a museum here, but we did not have the time to visit it. Well worth a day trip or even to spend the night. ",672
202,6671,"From Croatia we drove our rental car into Bosnia and stayed for two nights at the hotel Kriva Cuprija in Mostar. This hotel was a former mill (since 1558) and its a short walk over to Stari Most bridge. We had a great experience here, loved the area of Mostar. Its nice to see that they started rebuilding parts of the city since the war has ended. But on the outskirts of the tourist area you will still find many buildings damaged by the conflict. A lot of bullet holes and walls that have collapsed due to the shelling. What I was really impressed by was all the lighted candles at the various restaurants along the river at night, one word magical. While driving south we stopped to visit Medugorje. I wasnt expecting this place to be overtaken with Catholics visiting this holy site. There are more hotel rooms here than housing for the residents. This place has souvenir shops every few feet selling everything you can imagine with Jesus on it, that was a sight to behold in itself. Medugorje - this sleepy village has been transformed into one of the largest Catholic pilgrimages in the world. We continued to our next destination Dubrovnik Croatia.",245
203,6671,"From Madrid we headed for El Escorial, but we knew it would be closed because it was Monday. We just wanted to be there in its grandeur, and we also were going to Segovia. We went back to visit the Alcazar, aquaduct and the cathedral just as we did in 1999. This city deserves more than just a day trip. <br><br>DEC1999<br>From Madrid we drove our rental car to see the Alcazar in Segovia, Aquaduct and the Cathedral. The area was very impressive and we spent one night at the Hostal Residencia Plaza. Our next stop was Toledo. ",839
204,6671,"While everyone slept in the rental car I drove from Extremadura and sneeked into Toledo. We were not supposed to stop here but I remember that this was a very unique and beautiful city on the hill. After entering we stopped in a cafe to enjoy some tapas and some rare Pepsi in a bottle. This was to be a quick visit so we only took pictures of the cathedral and alcazar. After this visit we continued north to Madrid.  <br><br>DEC1999<br>We drove from Segovia to Toledo and spent the night at Hotel Residencia Imperio on one of the cities tiny streets. Luckily I had rented a small Renault Clio which made it easy to find a parking space. The main place to visit was the Alcazar which was nicely restored. On our drive south we stopped in Consuegra to take pictures next to the windmills, like those described in Cervantess Don Quixote. The further south we drove the nicer the Spaniards were.",838
205,6671,"We drove in from Andalusia to Merida where we spent the night at the Parador de Merida. People are very friendly and helpful here. The roman ruins in this city are excellent, we were surprised to see them scattered around the city almost at every turn. Our favorite was the Temple of Diana. Our next stop was Caceres to the north but we took a detour west to Badajoz so we could visit Portugal again. Once we where back in Spain we drove straight to Caceres where we spent one night at the Husa Gran Hotel Don. It was difficult locating this hotel but it ended up being a blessing. It was a short walk to the historical area of the city. During the day not much seemed to be going on here, but on Saturday night the city came alive. A lot of the restaurants outdoor tables were full but we found a place and had some good food. During the day we visited as many historical buildings and museums as time allowed, the cistern was a treat. Our next stop was a quick visit to Trujillo and then on our way to Castille La Mancha.

206,6671,"We arrived by ferry from Ceuta North Africa to Algeciras. Here is where I picked up my Hertz rental car for our journey through parts of Spain. Our first stop was Gibraltar where we stayed about 5 hours. Our hotel was Los Jandalos in Jerez de la Frontera where we spent two nights. This city was very nice which had a lot of character and beautiful old buildings. We like to stay in these uncommon cities that most tourists stay away from. At the hotel we had a very large suite with a large balcony, which gave us plenty of room. We went to the SPA to get massages and it was one of the worst massages I ever had. Since we were in the area we drove to Cadiz to visit the old part of the city, well worth a day trip. Our next stop was Merida in Extremadura. <br><br>DEC1999<br>On our drive from Toledo we passed through Cordoba, Granada, Malaga, Sevilla, and Huelva. <br>In Cordoba we stayed at the Hostal Almanzor and enjoyed this beautiful historical city. I wanted to see a flamenco show and we were able to get tickets to see Cardenal tablao flamenco. We were the only non Spaniard tourists here, and the show is one I would never forget, it was fantastic. Of course we could not miss visiting the Mezquita Cathedral. Our next night was spent in Granada at the Hotel Molinos. I took lots of pictures of the Alhambra, an architectual gem. A lot of our meals constisted of tortillas de patatas. We drove by Malaga and continued to Sevilla. We also had a short stop in Sevilla and spent the night at the border in a small town called Ayamonte. The Andalusians are very hospitable, the next day we drove into Portugal. ",832
207,6671,"We hired a taxi driver from Tangier to take us to the Ceuta border it costed us 300 dirhams. I paid a hustler 3 dirhams for 3 passport forms, you can get them free at the passport window. The customs agent stamped our passports and we walked through to the Spanish side. Passing the border was not difficult and pretty easy compared to what guidebooks might show. We took a taxi to our hotel which was the Tryp Ceuta. The hotel is in a convenient location and its easy to navigate the city streets. We went to have ice cream at the only McDonalds in town, it looks like an old fort. After traveling through Morocco for seven days it was a joy staying in this very clean and hussle free enclave. I enjoyed my morning espresso at La Alhambra cafe and our evening drinks at El Angulo bar restaurant inside the royal walls. This bar restaurant was very popular at night for its unique setting inside the fort. Most MTP members seem to just visit this enclave for a few hours and move on. We were glad we spent at least one night here since it was a very nice and tranquil place to be in, locals were always in a happy mood. At a travel agency we booked Acciona ferry to Algeciras Spain where we would continue our vacation. When entering the ferry the customs agents asked us where we were from, I told them Los Angeles. Both were surprised that we would come so far and stated that Californians are very rare in this area.",366
208,6671,"We entered Nador Morocco from Melilla, we seemed to be the only tourists crossing into the country. We noticed many Muslim women smuggling  cigarettes by taping the boxes to their bodies.<br>We took the 13km ride by taxi to the Nador train station. We booked 1st class train tickets because we had a six hour ride ahead of us. Since we had more than 3 hours to wait for the train to depart I walked over to the city center to exchange some US dollars for Dirhams. I seemed to be the only tourist here, I walked back to the train station and went across the road to the McDonalds restaurant nearby. This was a nice restaurant which overlooked the beach, a really nice location with a great view. It was a hot day and when we boarded the train we found out the air conditioner did not work properly. This ended up being an uncomfortable six hour train ride to Fes. Once we arrived at the Fes train station we had an easy walk next door to the hotel Ibis Moussafir Fes. Compared to Nador, Fes was a very busy and hectic city. We went out for dinner and I was approached by a local offering his services to guide us the next day to the medina. His english was very good so I took his offer of 150 dirhams for four hours of guiding us through the medina. The next day we paid the taxi to get us to the medina and did the usual walking tour of the medina plus going to the unpopular rug dealer. Of course they pushed us to buy a carpet but we turned down all offers since we had no interest in purchasing a rug. The carpet dealer was not happy but we have experienced this many times in the past in other countries and always leave without buying anything. At this point we lost our original guide and he was replaced by another to finish the rest of the tour. The pottery makers, the baker, and the tannery were all very interesting. After this experience I felt that having a guide at a Moroccan medina was not neccesary at all, we can do this on our own. Guide books and friends will tell you its best to have a guide, but for an experienced traveler a guide is not needed. I would of rather spent the time getting lost in the bazar and enjoying it without the carpet pushers. We continued by train to Meknes where we spent two nights at the Riad Felloussia in the medina. This was a very nice place to stay but once outside the summer heat was unbearable. I enjoyed the many food stalls and restaurants at Place el Hedim. While inside our Riad in Meknes it rained very hard for about an hour. I thought the streets would be flooded but to our amazement they were actually dry. Our main plan was to visit Volubilis, we took a grand taxi for 10 dirhams each to see the great roman ruins. The entrance fee is only 10 dirhams into the site and is well worth a visit. Our next train ride was to Rabat along the coast, the weather was very nice here. We spent two nights at the Hotel Ibis Moussafir Rabat next door to the Rabat Agdal train station. The capital was very tranquil and modern. We went to the Archaeology museum were we seemed to be the only visitors in a long time. The museum is difficult to locate but will be moved to the new art museum along Avenue Moulay Hassan. The next day we took the train to the ever famous Casablanca, this was also an enjoyable place to visit. It was a pleasure to walk around the medina without being pushed to buy something. We eventually purchased some plates and other souvenirs in the medina. We walked to the Hassan II Mosque which sits on the coast overlooking the sea. A lot of locals were enjoying themselves by jumping from the walls into the waters below. Our next stop was at Ricks Cafe which is a copy of the famous movie Casablanca. This restaurant features a lot of prop lookalikes that the movie features including the employees outfits. Compared to other restaurants in the area this place is very expensive, a Casablanca beer will cost you 60 dirhams. After going back to Rabat, we continued to Tangier by train where we spent one night at the hotel Ibis Tangier City Center next door to the train station. Tangier always gets a bad reputation regarding hustlers bothering the tourists. We did not see any of this and we really enjoyed this city along the water. The medina was easy to navigate and we found ourselves at the American Legation. Morocco is the first country to recognize the United States, in December 1777. This was a nice place to visit and we were lucky to be there before it closed for the day. Despite some issues we had with a few medina hustlers all came out well. Morocco is an easy place to visit with its helpful and friendly people. The following day we paid a taxi driver 300 dirhams to take us to the Ceuta border, the hotel taxi wanted 600 dirhams.",393
209,6671,"After visiting friends in Paris France for the day we flew to Catania on Meridiana Airlines. The first two nights we spent at the Sheraton Catania hotel and visited Giardini Naxos and Taormina by rental car. When we drove around Mt Etna every evening we could see the red lava spilling from the top, a really neat site. The locals consider themselves Sicilians and dont refer themselves as Italians. We loved the ruins in Agrigento and then drove north to Palermo. I was very suprised to see that this was no small town but a very busy and chaotic historical city. We decided to stay away from this traffic nightmare and spent the night in Cinisi along the beach. Our last night was at the Andrea Il Pirata hotel where we had a great dinner at their popular restaurant,owned by a very nice family. When we departed from Palermo we flew on Tunis Air to Tunis Tunisia to visit another friend.",315
210,6671,"We entered the country by bus, which was a very easy crossing from Croatia. The old city of Kotor has attracted a lot of day trip tour groups. There are very limited hotel rooms in the walled city. We ended up staying with an elderly lady in her apartment for $20 a night. Luckily we were able to stay with her as all the hotel rooms were sold out. The two nights here made for a memorable time in one of the newest countries in the world. The next day we took a bus to Podgorica so we can get over to Albania. The bus agents asked us why do you want to go to Albania. They told us nobody goes there. ",299
211,6671,"I arrived from Santiago del Estero Province by bus. I spent one night here at the Hostal San Pedro. There are a few places to visit in the historic part of the city. Plenty of Ice Cream parlors fill the area for the sweet loving locals. I stopped by the Post Office to buy stamps and they didnt have any, that was a first, a post office with no stamps. The train station here is closed, since the government shut it down years ago. The following day I went by bus to La Rioja Province.",752
212,6671,"From Catamarca I arrived in the afternoon when most of the city was on siesta. When I found the local hostal it was closed, not a good sign for a tourist. I decided I would not stay overnight at a hotel. Since I was here I decided to spend most of the day walking around the city. When night fell the city became swarmed with locals enjoying the warm evening. The outdoor seating areas of the restaurants were getting full everywhere. I ate dinner at a restaurant that was recommended to me, the pizza looked better than it tasted. I was disappointed with the food but still enjoyed the evening walking around the town. I took an overnight bus to the next stop San Juan Province.",761
213,6671,"Departed Salzburg Austria and I entered Munich by train. The weather was wet and gloomy but I enjoyed walking around the city enjoying the various historic areas. Since I was here I had my share of plenty of pints of German beer. I visited the Dachaus concentration camp, a very sad sight. Since I like automobiles I went to see the BMW museum at the headquarters. Then I wanted to see more German car museums so I took the train to Stuttgart in Baden-Wurttemberg.",804
214,6671,"Departed New York JFK airport on Austrian Airlines and arrived in Vienna. We spent one night at the Radisson Blu Palais hotel near the historic city center. We visited the UNESCO Schonbrunn Palace on a rainy day. We ate and enjoyed coffee at The Demel (since 1786), Cafe Central (since 1876), Cafe Hawelka (since 1939), and Griechenbeisl restaurant (since 1447). The next afternoon we departed VIE airport on Austrian Airlines and flew into Kiev Ukraine.<br><br>

Departed Krakow Poland I arrived in Vienna by train. I stayed at a hostal at Myrthegasse 7 which was very convenient to all the major sights. This city has so much to offer and too many sights to list. One day I did go to the Schonbrunn Palace which was really nice but since it was winter the flowers in the gardens were not in bloom. After departing Vienna I took the train to Budapest Hungary. After visiting Budapest I took the train back but this time to Salzburg. This is one beautiful city to visit and we went to the various Mozart sites and other historical parts. My next train ride was to Munich Germany.",240
215,6671,"We departed Subotica Serbia by bus entering into Szeged and spending a few hours in the city enjoying espresso drinks in the main plaza. We departed by train to Budapest where we would spend two nights at the Four Seasons Gresham Palace hotel. I had not been here in more than two decades and it brought back memories on how great this city is to visitors. We visited all the highlights crossing the Chain Bridge, Parliament, Fisherman's Bastion, Shoes on the Danube Bank, Ronald Reagan statue, and walked over to Margaret Island. One cannot be in Budapest without experiencing the Szazeves restaurant (since 1831), New York Cafe (since 1894), and the Matyas Pince Etterem (since 1904) all great places to eat. We departed Budapest by train to our next destination Bratislava Slovakia. 
<br><br>MAR1996<br>
Arriving from Vienna Austria by train I found a hostal that was close to all the major sights. The weather was much better with no snow on the ground to navigate. After seeing the various sights like the Danube river, chain bridge, heroes square, and many other places I needed a massage. My Chilean friend and I went to one of the many spa baths in the city and took advantage of the low prices. The massage I received from a big Hungarian was probably one of the best experiences from any of my spa visits worldwide. After paying our approximate $6 US dollars I felt like a million bucks. The food was great too and at lower prices than other European cities. I departed Budapest by train back to Salzburg Austria.",273
216,6671,"We departed on LOT Polish Airlines from VNO airport Lithuania to WAW airport in Poland where we would spend one night at the Sheraton Warsaw Hotel near the old town. We enjoyed walking around old town and must've walked several miles that first day admiring all the historic buildings some that were reconstructed after World War 2. We ate at several Restauracja Zapiecek restaurants because we enjoy eating pierogis. We departed WAW airport back to LAX airport on LOT Polish Airlines.  
<br><br>AUG2017<br>We departed Bratislava Slovakia connecting through Czech Republic arriving into Krakow Poland by train. We would spend 3 nights at the Red Brick Apartment hotel near the train station. No visit to Krakow can be complete without visiting Auschwitz Birkenau and the Wieliczka Salt Mines. Other points of interest were the Jewish District, Oskar Schindlers Factory, Ghetto Heroes Square, and the Rakowicki Cemetery. I ate dinner at Wentzl (since 1792) in the vibrant Market Square. This was the end of our vacation and we departed on Austrian Airlines back to LAX airport.

I took a train from Prague to Krakow, when I arrived I was happy to find a place to stay at a hostal convent run by nuns. The weather was very cold so I had to purchase a pull over jacket to stay warm. I visited the state museum of Auschwitz and Birkenau, while walking around the compound I could just imagine how cruel the conditions must have been. Here I was trying to keep warm all bundled up and the prisoners must of froze to death with probably nothing to keep them warm. There were just a handful of tourists walking the area since the weather was so cold and dreary. The next day I went to the Wieliczka salt mines, the place was amazing and huge. The highlight of this tour is seeing all the carvings and the church the miners carved out of salt. Despite the cold weather outside I always enjoyed a cold Polish beer with my dinner. I continued by train to Vienna Austria.",304
217,6671,"I flew on Trans World Airlines through JFK airport to Frankfurt, then immediately took a flight on Czech Air to Prague. When I arrived at the airport I was able to obtain a room from a lady for $20 a night. It was close to the city and I felt at home here. Of course it was still winter and snow had fallen everywhere, it was very cold out. I went to the popular tourist spots despite the weather. After two nights here I took a train to Krakow Poland.

218,6671,"I always rent a car to drive around this province, too many places to visit. You can take a day tour from Cancun but its better to be on your own. There are english speaking guides at the entrance and inside if you would rather have someone lecture to you. Inside Chichen Itza its amazing, one can only imagine what work it must of took for hundreds or thousands of people to build this place. This is not a place to go for just a few hours, I would recommend you spend most of day here as there is a lot to see and a lot of walking, dont forget to bring your sun hat.",674
219,6671,"Arriving from San Juan by bus I knew Mendoza would have a lot to offer. This is a big city with plenty of things to do. The day I arrived I went on a wine and olive oil tasting tour. It was a bit disappointing with the wine tasting as they only offered us a few samples, but it was still a nice experience. Cant be in famous Mendoza without going to the wineries. The Laur olive oil company stop was interesting and the oil was very good. I also had the chance to visit Cacheuta which has thermal waters. Before going to the waters I went to the Hotel & Spa Termas Cacheuta to get a massage. Since this area is well known for its massages I thought it would be a great experience. It ended up being the worst massage I have ever paid for at such a nice place. The thermal waters were very nice and the place was crowded, the only drawback that there are no lockers to keep your things in. After a couple of nights here I flew back to AEP Buenos Aires airport.",762
220,6671,"I arrived on an overnight bus from La Rioja. The bus had stopped and luckily I woke up to find we were at San Juans bus station, the driver didnt announce the stop. Most of the passengers on the bus were asleep and only three passengers got off including myself. I went by a local city bus to the main plaza early in the morning. I enjoyed some espresso and a pastry at a quiet corner cafe. This area doesnt offer much for a tourist to stay so I just stayed a few hours and continued to Mendoza by bus.",767
221,6671,"When I arrived at the bus station and started walking toward the center of town, I wasnt expecting to like this place. Once I arrived in the Plaza Independencia area things changed for the better.  A very nice historic city with plenty to see and do. The tourist office is very nice and provides plenty of information for the area. I spent one night here and ate at a local restaurant called El Portal serving comida del Norte. I ate some locro served in artisans bread, it was very delicious. The next day I took a bus to the province Santiago del Estero.",773
222,6671,"We took an Air Jamaica flight from Montego Bay into Havana. Our hotel was the Horizontes in New Havana which was a moderate place with no character. I love old cars so when we needed a ride into Old Havana I would flag down a citizen driving an old car and ask for a ride. A ride into the old part would cost us a $1 each. The drivers would always leave us nearby so they would not get caught by the police for giving a tourist a ride. The city has so much character and feels like its frozen in time. One of the main plazas where citizens would park look like a car show with all the antique cars. Since its difficult and expensive to maintain these vehicles most would have bald and different size tires and were painted by brush. There are many different historical places to visit in Old Havana and the beautiful classic hotels are here also. We took a bus to Santa Maria beach to lay out for a while, but we enjoy the city more and returned after a few hours. Our next flight was to SDQ airport in the Dominican Republic on Cubana Airlines. This is one of the most dangerous airlines in the world flying old Russian jets.",188

We all wanted to stay here and spend the night. After a brief tour we had free time to see the city on our own. Someday I would like to go back, the city is well known for its lace and there are many shops selling it. We had lunch at a beer garden restaurant and the food was excellent. We also went to visit Gent and this was another great city to walk around in. The Gravensteen castle was one of places we visited then we ate at another beer garden restaurant at Groentenmarkt 9. The cuisine in this region is not to be missed, one of the best in Europe. ",801

The next day I took a bus to Tucuman.",766

My friend Daniel and I spent the night at Hostal Litoral in Copacabana, a sleepy town at the border with lots of charm. From here we took a small boat and visited Isla del Sol, where farm families live on this harsh rocky and hilly island. We crossed the border back to Peru so we could catch our flight back home from Lima. ",164
226,6671,"We flew on Saeta airlines from San Cristobal Galapagos to Guayaquil then by TAME airlines to Quito. This was a really nice city to visit, it has lots of old world charm. We went on a day trip to Banos, a lot of hand made taffy shops are located here. You can watch them make taffy right in front of the shops. There are thermal waters in Banos which we took advantage of and relaxed in these waters. The cities are very clean with little or no trash on the city streets. I always try the local cuisine and we went to this small popular restaurant in Quito that was full of locals. The food was really good, but I got very sick and I was not feeling well for several days.<br>I well never forget those days of suffering, I have never been that ill before. After staying in Quito we decided to go across the border to Popoyan Columbia. ",168
227,6671,"We started in Miami and flew to Guayaquil on Saeta Airlines. One night was spent in Guayaquil before continuing the next day to San Cristobal airport also with Saeta Airlines. Visitors to the Galapagos have to pay a tourist fee of $80 USD on arrival. This is not a place where visitors come to lay out on the beach but to explore nature at its best. We only spent four days here and were offered a cruise around the islands. If you want to see all the different islands you have to be here at least 10 days. We took a boat over to Santa Cruz to visit the Charles Darwin scientific station. There are so many different species of turtles and we actually saw Lonesome George before he died. We had a guide who took us all around the island, to see the turtles, swim with the baby seals, iguanas, blue footed boobies, get in a lagoon with harmless sharks, and a lot more. This place is amazing if you are into nature. ",18
228,6671,"This was one of our cruise stops with Premier cruises Big Red Boat. We did the touristy thing and signed up for a few activities. Visiting with the dolphins was a lot of fun, then after that my friend went parasailing. We had a taxi driver take us to Paradise Island to see the Atlantis. Ive seen a lot of resorts in my life and this one really impressed me. I loved walking around this place and just was amazed on how beautiful it was and the imagination they put into it. Fort Charlotte was another place we stopped to walk around. Of course we went to the Straw Market to get the typical souvenirs everyone sells there. ",183

I have traveled thoughout this state for decades and still havent seen everything. Everytime we take a short vacation we always take different routes to see new towns and cities weve never been to. This always leads us to beautiful hidden gems that no one really talks about or visits. With over 1200 wineries and hundreds of breweries in the state it will take us a very long time to visit all of them. The year round good weather in California makes traveling an anytime destination.

I was very happy with the food here, the restaurants are crowded with locals and tourists seeing this vibrant city. There are some fast food restaurants, like Burger King among these restaurants but you wont notice them that easy. The fast food signs are not neon bright and are basically hidden amongst the historic buildings. Of course avoid these fast food places and try some authentic Pueblano food. While walking around the city I stopped by the Hotel Casa de la Palma at 3 Oriente 217, this is a beautiful old hotel with lots of character.

It was our nations first state and has a lot of history and is worth a full day, even to spend a night. You wont go wrong by staying at the luxury Hotel DuPont which opened in 1913. I have stayed and seen many luxury hotels and I was very impressed by this one. On Market street the main street of the city sits the Grand Opera House opened in 1871, it has an outstanding cast iron facade. The Delaware History center is on Market and 6th Street.

I got the Afghan visa in Kyrgyzstan\'s Bishkek for $161 with a 1-day wait.  I flew into Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  Took a 16 hour train ride to Termiz.  Paid $20 for a taxi to the famed Uzbek-Afghan Friendship Bridge where they spent 4 hours looking at every .jpg on my laptop.  Then waited for an hour until a randon teenager stopped and drove me to Mazar-e-sharif for $18.

I stayed at the Barat Hotel for $80 a night.  

I wanted to visit Balkh, only 30 km away (the birthplace of Zoroaster, Ibn Sina, and Rumi!!)  however the police thought I\'d get captured by Taliban on that road, so they did not grant permission for me a travel there.  

After 3 nights, I returned to Uzbekistan where the customed scoured my laptop for another 4 hours (yay!)

1,35,"First of all, I like traveling to any place where they speak Portugese, which in my opinion is the most beautiful language in the world.  My wife and I visited Portugal and the Azores in October 2005 and had a blast!  Lisbon is one of the great capitals of Europe.  The views from Lisbon's many hills are breathtaking although I must say I was a little put off by all of the graffitti.  We also visited the quaint village of Sintra, the amazing walled Renaissance town of Evora and the stunning Algarve coast in Southern Portugal.  Highlights included the delicious food and drink I had throughout Portugal including the interestingly paired, but incredibly tasty pork and clams, sardinhas asados, arroz con mariscos, vinho verde and of course Portugal's most famous wine . . . Port!  We also had an amazing time hiking up a mountain to Sintra's Palace and Moorish Castle and wandering the cobblestoned streets of Evora.  Finally, we relaxed on the sun-drenched beaches and coves of the Algarve . . . which to me evoked images of both the brilliant red-rock Bryce Canyon and the azure waters of the Mediterranean.  We explored the beautiful Algarve from our base in Lagos and while there, made it out to Cabo Sao Vicente (the most southwestern point of Europe).  One day I plan to return to Portugal and head north from Lisbon to Obidos, Coimbra and the famous Duoro Valley.",305
2,35,"In December 1999, I did one of Australia&apos;s classic overland trips up its Eastern Coast from Sydney to Cairns.  Although I didn&apos;t have time to see everything I would have liked to and plan to return one day to explore some more, highlights of my trip included the following:  skydiving and learning how to surf on the Gold Coast; off-roading through and swimming in crystal-clear lakes on breathtaking Fraser Island; spotting some wild koalas in Noosa National Park; standing on the Tropic of Capricorn; sailing through the azure waters of the Whitsunday Islands; whitewater rafting the Tully River; circumnavigating Magnetic Island by jet-ski; riding through the canopies of Northern Queensland&apos;s tropical rainforests on Kuranda&apos;s skyrail; and of course scuba diving the Great Barrier Reef.

3,35,"I was in Copenhagen for a few days in July 1999 on my summer backpacking trip through Europe. We arrived by train from Amsterdam after being booted off in the middle of the night in Hamburg along with two dozen other people who, like us, did not know they needed a reservation for the Hamburg - Copenhagen segment. Strangely, many of those uninformed individuals were the same folks who were in the same Amsterdam ""Coffehouse"" as we were before boarding the train. Anyway, we did manage to catch another train from Hamburg later that next morning. My most vivid memory of Denmark is that Danish women are gorgeous!!! </p>",258
4,35,"I flew into Cancun in December 2007 to attend my good friend's wedding that was held on a stunning stretch of coast about 10 miles south of Tulum.  I landed in Cancun in the evening time and immediately left the next morning by myself in a rental car to visit the famous Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza and an incredible limestone cavern called Cenote Dzinup in the state of Yucatan.  From the state of Yucatan, I cut back over to Tulum in Quintana Roo by traveling southeast by car through thick rainforest.  Once back over the border in Quintana Roo, I visited the less famous, but equally as impressive Mayan ruins of Coba.  From Coba, I continued my drive back to the Caribbean coast to the site of my friend's wedding.  I rented an incredible beach bungalow on a quiet, secluded stretch of beach where I hung out with some of my law school friends for a few days eating delicious fresh ceviche, drinking an exorbitant amount of cerveza and of course, swimming in the Caribbean's warm, translucent waters.  From there, I headed back up the coast visiting the ruins of Tulum and a number of stunning, deserted beaches on the way.  My next stop was Playa del Carmen which I did not like at all. . .way too touristy!  I had booked a room for 2 nights though in Playa del Carmen so I had to figure out what to do with myself . . . I decided to take a ferry over to Cozumel one of those days.  I expected Cozumel to be a lot more beautiful than it was. . .it is after all on the itinerary of just about every major cruise line in the Western Caribbean.  Cozumel is a flat, dry and featureless island although I understand the off-shore diving is superb.  I did enjoy circumnavigating Cozumel, however, by scooter, which I managed to nearly kill myself on at one point during the day.  The story goes like this . . .I was returning to my scooter from scoping out a beach to see if it was a good place to go for a snorkel.  Having determined that it wasn't a good place to snorkel, I got back on my scooter that I had parked on the side of the road facing oncoming traffic.  I had never rode a scooter by myself before until that day so I was still just getting the hang of it.  I put on my helmet and gave it what I thought was just a little bit of gas so that I could make a u-turn and go the other way.  Instead, I accidently gave it a lot of gas and then frantically tried to hit the breaks as I was going into oncoming traffic.  In my frantic state, however, I just kept hitting the gas, so I'm now flying down Cozumel's highway going the wrong way with cars coming at me.  I still had enough wherewithal to swerve off the road to avoid a collision, so now I've swerved off the road, but I'm still hitting the gas instead of the brakes as I fly through a field of grass (probably 1 meter high) that's cutting up my legs.  I then swerve back onto the road, do a sharp 180 spin that causes the front shield of my scooter to crack on the pavement before I come to a complete stop.  I was shaken up to say the very least convinced that I had almost killed myself.  Amazingly, the scooter rental place said nothing about the cracked shield when I returned it later that night as I was expecting to have to shell out more money for the damage.  The next day I traveled up the coast back to Cancun and took the ferry over to tranquil Isla Muejeres.  While on Isla Mujeres, I met an ex-pat the locals call Captain Ron.  He owns a bar in Playa and was on vacation up in Isla Mujeres with his black labrador retriever.  Captain Ron, myself and the black lab hung out under a beach palapa all day long drinking cerveza after cerveza. . .I don't remember the ferry ride back to Cancun!       ",666

I just wanted to say that I had the time of my life during a week long cruise through the archipelago in February 2006. We had clear, sunny weather during our entire trip, although the hot equatorial sun was sometimes over-bearing. Espanola and Floreana were by far and away the most beautiful islands we visited. Our snorkeling adventures included seals, Galapagos penguins and marine iguanas that swam right up to our snorkel masks. Above the water, the blue-footed boobies, frigate birds, land iguanas, and giant tortoises were equally impressive. I hope to one day return to the Galapagos to visit the island of Genovesa to see red-footed boobies. </p>",18

8,35,"During Spring Break of my last year in law school, my friends and I decided to fly down to Puerto Vallarta.  Rather than party with the rest of the Spring Breakers, we left Puerto Vallarta after about 2 days and began to drive down the Pacific coast on Highway 200.  We made it all the way down to the state of Michoacan and visited parts of Jalisco and Colima on the way.  In Jalisco, we visited a stunnning stretch of coast called the Costa Careyes, which is about 1-2 hours south of Puerto Vallarta.  Costa Careyes is a very quiet and tranquil place with colorful villas dotting its hills that overlook many beautiful ocean coves.  We stopped at a very fancy exclusive resort for an octopus ceviche lunch and an ocean swim, both of which were amazing!  After that we continued to drive south with no end destination in mind.  As the sun began to set, we made the decision to stop somewhere for the night having been warned by the locals of the risk of being held up by banditos if we drove during the night.  First though, our rental car&apos;s tire blew out, so we had to pull over and put on the spare.  Not knowing how reliable our spare tire was, we decided we would just stay in the next town we rolled into.  That town was San Patricio (also known as Melanque) and unbeknownst to us, it was March 17th . . .St. Patrick&apos;s Day, so wouldn&apos;t you know it, the town named after St. Patrick was throwing a huge fiesta that night!  That night we partied with the locals in the town&apos;s bull ring, which included watching a bull fight, dancing to the tunes of the famous Banda Limon, watching the fireworks and eating some delicious tacos.  It was a very fun evening and because San Patricio is so far off the beaten path, we were practically the only foreigners there.",656
9,35,"The Society Islands are 1 of 5 island groups that make up French Polynesia and home to its capital, Papetee on the island of Tahiti.  As a child, I dreamed of visiting Bora Bora, which I would regularly hear dubbed on tv programs as the ""Most Beautiful Island in the World.""  My wife and I, therefore, decided to honeymoon in French Polynesia in May/June 2004.  We started in Bora Bora, then hopped over to Moorea before ending our romantic island adventures on Rangiroa in the Tuamotus.  Although Bora Bora is a very popular tourist destination these days, it is still drop-dead gorgeous.  Because it was our honeyomoon, we decided to splurge and stay in an overwater bungalow at the Pearl Resort.  All I can say is ""WOW!""  It doesn&apos;t get any better than having your own sun deck hanging off your hotel room with a ladder down into a crystal clear lagoon.  You could even feed the tropical fish that swam beneath your bungalow by removing the glass off of your coffee table.  Days were spent snorkeling in Bora Bora&apos;s warm translucent waters, paddling by canoe to one of Bora Bora&apos;s many motus, feeding ferocious sharks, or just taking in the scenery from the deck of our bungalow.  Nights were spent feasting on fresh seafood, including poisson cru (raw tuna in coconut milk and lime juice), and lying underneath the Tahitian moon again from the deck of our bungalow.  We even had a breakfast of fresh tropical fruits and croissants canoed right up to our bungalow one morning!  After Bora Bora, it was on to Moorea.  Although Moorea does not have nearly as beautiful of a lagoon as Bora Bora, it does have towering jungle-covered peaks.  We circumnavigated the entire island of Moorea by car one day and nearly biked around half of the island another day.  Shark feeding was especially spectacular on Moorea.  To make our connection from Moorea to Rangiroa, we had to fly back to Tahiti.  One thing that I always like to tell people about my 8 minute flight from Moorea to Tahiti is that we landed at our destination before we were even scheduled to take off!  It&apos;s true and pretty weird when you say it like that, but because all the passengers had checked in about 30 minutes before our scheduled take-off, they decided to board us and take off early, thus allowing us to arrive before our scheduled departure!",66

The Northern Territory is of course home to the expansive Australian Outback, one of Earth&apos;s great natural sanctuaries.  Highlights of my trip included watching Ayers Rock change colors before my very eyes both at sunrise and at sunset, hiking through the geologic wonders of the Olgas, Kings Canyon and Devil&apos;s Marbles, watching the sunrise over the Outback from a hot-air balloon and then getting completely obliterated at 7:00 in the morning off the champagne and chicken breakfast that came with the hot-air balloon ride, soaking in Mataranka&apos;s thermal pools below thousands of bats, swimming beneath waterfalls and being scared out of a bathroom stall by a frilled-neck lizard in Litchfield National Park, the scenic flight and boat rides through crocodile-infested Kakadu National Park, eating live silk worms, kangaroo tail and other Aboriginal specialities on a Bushtucker tour, finding an eight foot long cobra at my feet while stepping out of a pub in the middle of nowhere, and soaking in all of my NT experiences over a few VBs in Darwin.

12,35,"My wife and I vistited the BVI during a two week trip through the Caribbean.  We stayed in Tortola for 3 nights and using that as our base traveled to St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to Virgin Gorda.  In my opinion, Virgin Gorda is the most beautiful island in the BVI, but I haven&apos;t been to Anageda or Jost Van Dyke, so my opinion might change one day after visiting those two islands.  While on Virgin Gorda, we explored the world-famous Baths; large rock out-croppings on Virgin Gorda&apos;s south shore that look somewhat similar to the granite rocks you see on some Seychelles&apos; beaches.  We also rented our own little schooner to explore Virgin Gorda&apos;s gorgeous, multi-colored North Sound.  The North Sound is dotted with picture-perfect islands and coral reefs.  Two islands that we stopped on were Saba Rock (not to be confused with Saba in the Netherlands Antilles) to grab a bite to eat and Eustatia Island (also not to be confused with St. Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles) to swim in it&apos;s warm off-shore waters.  Our time in paradise was unfortunately dampered by me losing my wedding ring while hopping in and out of our schooner in the North Sound and then several days later when I left our camera on our LIAT flight down to Grenada.

16,35,"My wife and I honeymooned in French Polynesia in May and June of 2004. After enjoying the islands of Bora Bora and Moorea in the Society Islands, we flew over to Rangiroa in the Tuamotus for a few days. Rangiroa was spectacular! We stayed at the Kia Ora which was expensive, but worth the splurge for a honeymoon. If you visit Rangiroa, the two things that you must do is visit the Blue Lagoon and shoot the pass via a drift snorkel. The Blue Lagoon is a smaller lagoon enclosed within Rangiroa&apos;s larger lagoon. I often refer to my trip to the Blue Lagoon as the best day of my life. The weather could not have been more beautiful. Our two Polynesian guides could not have been nicer and the scenery could not have been more impressive. The Blue Lagoon is the epitome of paradise!!! Its shallow waters were swarming with small black-tipped sharks that I fed fish guts to. You could swim from one little motu (island) to the next through crystal clear waters. Our guides prepared us (and the only other couple who accompanied us on our trip) a scruptious beach BBQ which included some of the best fish and potato salad I have ever tasted. On our trip back to the Kia Ora across Rangiroa&apos;s huge lagoon, we spotted a manta ray and a tiger shark. We also went for a snorkel at a little island smack dab in the middle of Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon where we were treated to some sea turtles. The next day, we shot the pass (we drift snorkeled through one of the two passes that connect Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon to the ocean). The current is so strong that you don&apos;t even need to swim. . .you are just carried by the current into the lagoon. It was by far the best snorkel of my life. Visibility was probably at 200 feet plus. The bottom of the pass had somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 large grey sharks (that was the approximate count made by our guide). Towards the end of our snorkel, we passed over a plateau where the ocean floor came within 10 meters of us. Never in my life had I witnessed so many colors all in one place. There were thousands upon thousands of fish of all diffferent sizes and shades. My wife and I were blown away by what we were looking at! Rangiroa was one of the highlights of all my travels and I hope that one day, I&apos;ll have the chance to visit it again and also visit some of its Tuamotu neighbors including Fakarava and Manihi. </p>",75

We drove several hundred miles south along Mexico&apos;s beautiful Highway 200 through the entire states of Jalisco and Colima and into the northern parts of Michoacan. Highway 200 is particularly beautiful in Michoacan as it hugs the Pacific Ocean most of the way. We overnighted in a tiny, rural fishing village called Maruata (population probably less than 100 people) that is ideally sandwiched bewteen a few picture-perfect coves. Maruata is a popular spot for hippies who come to just chill out for a while and enjoy the solitude and fresh ceviche. We rented a rustic cabana right on the beach, were lulled to sleep by the sounds of farm animals that wandered throughout the village and were treated to some of the best eggs, beans and tortillas I have ever had for breakfast the following morning. </p>",659

We got to the Tobago Cays from Mayreu on a local fisherman&apos;s beat-up old boat and on the way over, we were sure that we would capsize as the fisherman took ten foot swells head on. Thankfully, capsizing was not in the cards and as our boat finally entered the calm waters surrounding the cays, my wife and I became awestruck by all of the gorgeous colors that surround these little islands. After doing some snorkeling, we relaxed and sun-bathed on one of the cays before heading back over to Mayreu.</p>",195
22,35,"We hopped on over to Sao Miguel from Lisbon for a few days in October 2005, which proved to not be enough time to thoroughly enjoy these mid-Atlantic jewels. The island of Sao Miguel was like a fairytale (rolling hills of green farmlands, roads lined with thousands of blue hydrangeas, perfectly manicured public gardens, amazingly blue and green volcanic lakes, and bubbling geysers).

24,35,"When visiting the Dominican Republic recently, I decided to cross the border over to Haiti. Since my wife is not as crazy of a country-collector as myself, she decided to stay behind in the DR; Sosua to be exact on the North Coast. I traveled by bus from Sosua via Santiago and Monte Cristi to the Dominican town of Dajabon right on the Haitian border. The bus ride took me about 4-5 hours one way. I got to the border at about noon and after paying some departure taxes was let across the border. I think I may have been the only person crossing the border that day who wasn&apos;t either Dominican or Haitian. Suffice to say, I was a curious sight to people on both sides of the border who weren&apos;t use to seeing that many foreigners. Once I crossed the border, I walked around the Haitian town of Oanaminthe for a couple of hours. There wasn&apos;t much to see . . . Haiti is a lot poorer than its neighboring country. After asking a local where I could get a Haitian beer, the friendly man eagerly guided me to where I thought I could sit down, escape the blazing Caribbean sun and relax a bit with a cold beverage. Next thing I knew, however, I had been led to a brothel. Who knows, maybe ""beer"" is the code word for something else in Haiti. I politely declined the services being offered to me, but was still able to have that cold Haitian beer (the brothel had a cooler full of them). I then made my way back to the border at which point I was told by Haitian customs officials that the border had for no apparent reason been closed for the rest of the day. Having no way of contacting my wife to let her know I was stranded in Haiti for the night, I calmly began to worry. Next thing I knew, a nice Haitian guy offers to put me on his shoulders and walk me across the not so beautiful river that divides Haiti and the DR. I posted a picture of the river on Haiti&apos;s link on the Master List. You can see the friendly Haitian guy who helped me across in the lower part of the picture wearing an orange shirt. The picture also shows that I wasn&apos;t the only person who crossed the border in an ""unofficial"" way that afternoon. Just because I know here at Most Traveled People, we don&apos;t promote the illegal entry into countries, it is worth noting that even though I re-entered the DR in a somewhat suspicious manner, I immediately made my way to the DR customs office to clear customs after I was dropped off on the Dominican side of the river bank. Even though the border had been locked up for the past hour or so, the Dominican customs office didn&apos;t even ask me how I was all of sudden back in their country. . .oh well. While my adventures in Haiti were limited to just a short period of time, it was definitely one of the more adventurous few hours of my traveling career. </P>",198
25,35,"Flew into Manaus from Miami and then headed up the Rio Negro about 2 to 3 hours by boat to the Ariau Jungle Lodge.

The ""Meeting of the Waters"" is where the Amazon and Rio Negro meet, but strangely the rivers do not immediately blend due to their different temperatures and chemical compositions . . .it was a very unusual sight to behold (see my photo in Amazonas, Brazil link). Manuas can be reached by plane from just about every other major city in Brazil, can be reached from Miami on TAM Airlines (about a 4 hour flight) and can be reached from Panama City on Copa Airlines.

NEW DELHI &mdash; A 27-year-old American tourist was killed by members of one of India&rsquo;s most isolated hunter-and-gatherer tribes, according to police in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>

<p>The American man, John Allen Chau, paid five fishermen to take him to North Sentinel Island, said Deepak Yadav, a senior police official in the city of Port Blair.</p>

<p>The island is home to the tiny Sentinelese tribe, whose members reject contact with the wider world and react with hostility and violence to attempts by outsiders to interact with them. The island is off-limits to visitors under Indian law.</p>

<p>Yadav said that Chau and the fishermen arrived at the island around midnight on Nov. 14. The next day, Chau used a kayak to approach the island and attempted to speak with the islanders, who have been known to fire arrows at interlopers. The fishermen told police that they last saw Chau alive on Friday.</p>

<p><br />
The following morning, they saw his body &ldquo;being dragged and then buried,&rdquo; Yadav said.</p>

<p>Police sent a helicopter to conduct reconnaissance on Tuesday and a separate team also traveled to the area on Wednesday. An investigation is underway, and the fishermen involved have been arrested, as has a friend of Chau&rsquo;s in Port Blair who helped organize the boat trip to the island, the police official said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were very well aware of the situation, but they still arranged for a boat and everything,&rdquo; said Yadav, a move he described as &ldquo;pushing [Chau] in the mouth of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chau, who was born in Alabama, had made four prior trips to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands starting in 2015 and arrived in Port Blair in mid-October on a tourist visa, according to police. Police also discovered a journal belonging to Chau where he wrote about his desire to spread God&rsquo;s word.</p>

<p><br />
&ldquo;We are aware of reports concerning a U.S. citizen in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,&rdquo; said a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in the southern Indian city of Chennai in a statement. &ldquo;When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one knows exactly how many Sentinelese live on North Sentinel Island. Attempts by Indian census officials to count them from a distance have put their number at fewer than 100.</p>

<p>The Indian government adopted a policy of &ldquo;isolation with minimal intervention&rdquo; toward the Sentinelese and several other tribes in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which are located in the Bay of Bengal off the eastern coast of India.</p>

<p>In 2006, the Sentinelese allegedly killed two fishermen whose boat drifted onto the island after they fell asleep. The tribal people reportedly fired arrows at helicopters sent to retrieve the bodies.</p>

0,23,"""A Cruise to Tristan da Cunha Island in the South Atlantic 15-28 January 2004 via the RMS St. Helena"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2004. <br><br>PART ONE:<br><br>The British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), 1,750 miles (2,816 km) southwest of Cape Town and 1,450 miles (2,333 km) southwest of St. Helena Island, is the most remote inhabited island in the world.  Roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo and situated just east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, TDC rises spectacularly some 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) from the seabed; and its peak, snow-covered during the Southern Hemisphere winter, lies 6,760 feet (2,060 meters) above sea level.<br><br>Discovered by the Portuguese admiral Tristao da Cunha in 1506, TDC has been inhabited almost continuously since 1810 due to the activities of sealers who operated in the South Atlantic during the nineteenth century.  A small British garrison was also placed on the island during the early years of Napoleons captivity on nearby St. Helena.<br><br>The correct pronunciation of the Portuguese admiral's name is ""tristan da koon'yah.""  However, the modern-day inhabitants pronounce the name of their island ""tristan da koo'nah."" <br><br>I have been fascinated by the geography and history of remote TDC since<br>I began collecting stamps as a young teenager in the early 1960s.  In 1999 I joined the St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Philatelic Society.  But it was my passion to complete the list of 317 world destinations compiled by the 1,500-member Travelers' Century Club of Los Angeles which recently drove me to take a 13-day cruise round trip from Cape Town to TDC on a luxury cargo vessel, the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS). <br><br>Launched in 1989 by HRH The Prince Andrew, the RMS was the first vessel to be purpose-built for the shipping service to U. K.s South Atlantic islands of St. Helena, Ascension and TDC.  In addition, it was the first passenger ship to be constructed in Britain since the QE2 had been built two decades earlier.<br><br>As we sailed out of Cape Town Harbor, the view from the deck of the RMS  was stunning.  Cape Town, with dramatic Table Mountain behind, is the most beautiful port in the world.  Half way to Cape Point, the RMS turned abruptly and headed toward TDC which lay about 1,748 miles (2,812 km) to the west.<br><br>TDC, a dependency of St. Helena, is administered by the governor of that island, to whom a permanent administrator on TDC reports.  The current governor, H. E. David Hollamby, was also on board the RMS for its final round trip sailing to TDC.  Although the RMS has a capacity of 128 passengers, only 57 were on board for this cruise, along with 56 crew members.  And the RMS was carrying only 38 metric tons of cargo to TDC even though the ship has a cargo capacity of 2,030 metric tons.  Sadly, Governor Hollamby said that it had become impossible to justify the expense of the annual RMS voyage to TDC when usage was so low.  <br><br>Due to rain and clouds on the morning of 21 January, TDC could not be seen until the RMS was only about two miles (3 km) away!  Africa Pilot, published by the U. K. Hydrographic Office, says that TDC, at 37 degrees, 7 minutes S., 12 degrees 18 minutes W., is a ""truncated cone about 6 miles in diameter with its sides rising at an angle of about 45 degrees to a central peak 2,060 meters in height.  The sides of the island consist of walls of inaccessible cliffs from 300 meters to 610 meters in height which rise, except on its northwest side, directly from the sea.  On this side there is, in front of the cliffs, a comparatively low grassy slope from 30 meters to 60 meters high which terminates in Herald Point, the northwest extremity of the island.  The sides of the mountain mass as far as the central dome are covered with brushwood intermixed with ferns and long grass.  But above 1500 meters, coinciding with the normal upper level of clouds, the mountains consist of loose stones and volcanic rubble with occasional rocks and boulders.""  <br><br>The RMS dropped anchor off Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, TDC's only settlement.  Formerly called Somerset, Edinburgh had been renamed after the 1867 visit of HRH The Prince Albert, second son of Queen Victoria.  Interestingly, the current Duke of Edinburgh, HRH The Prince Philip, also visited TDC.  The population of Edinburgh is 285.<br><br>Upon our arrival, some of the crew began fishing off the poop deck for yellowfish and five fingers using hooks and lines with bait; and it seemed as if they were pulling in one fish after the next.  As soon as one fish was snagged, hauled in and placed in a plastic sack, each fisherman re-baited and awaited the next bite, which didn't take long.  The waters off TDC are simply teeming with fish.<br><br>The first boat out to the RMS carried the administrator, the islands only policeman and three immigration officials who sat at a table in the main lounge where passengers who wished to go ashore paid a Sterling 15 (USD 28) landing fee.  Passports were stamped using a rubber stamp with a design showing a yellow-nosed albatross (known locally as a ""mollymauk""), the silhouette of the island and the British crown along with the words, ""Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""<br> <br>Governor Hollamby's official party was in the first boat to go ashore.  I was in the first of two other passenger boats after that.  The use of a rope ladder and safety harness off the RMS in a heavy swell made it very slow going.  Passengers had been warned how dangerous it can be to disembark and embark using the rope ladder as ones foot can be crushed  between the RMS and one of the small boats.  During the past 20 years no passenger injuries had ever resulted from the use of a rope ladder on the RMS at TDC.  But in 2003 one crew member did break his foot.<br><br>Edinburgh's shallow Calshot Harbor was named after the former Royal Air Force station near Southampton where the Tristanians had lived for about a year following their evacuation after a volcanic eruption on TDC in 1961.  Calshot Harbor's two jetties had been sturdily constructed of double-ended anchor-shaped concrete blocks.<br><br>Removing the life vest I had worn ashore in the boat, I walked up the paved road to the often-photographed sign which reads, ""Welcome to the Remotest Island - Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""  Adjacent to that sign is a marker which points the direction and mileage to various points around the globe:  Nightingale Island is 22 miles (35 km) away, the Falkland Islands are 2,166 miles (3,485 km) away and London is 5,337 miles (8,587 km) away.<br><br>After visiting the post office, I walked to the three-room museum and handicraft center.  The museum featured a copy of the flag of Jonathan Lambert, an American who had declared himself emperor of the ""Islands of Refreshment"" (TDC) in 1811.  The ensign of the Duke of Edinburgh, which last flew at TDC during the January 1957 royal visit of HRH The Prince Philip, was also displayed.  In addition, a cannon ball and various old rusted implements were shown.  In another room unique TDC wingless moths were displayed as were various geological specimens, a TDC crayfish (fishing for crayfish, or rock lobster, is the mainstay of the economy) and even the head of a rare Tasman whale which had once beached in the TDC Archipelago.  In that same room was a photocopy obtained from the British Museum of TDC's original constitution which dated back to 1817.<br><br>Then I went by the Rectory to the Residency, where the administrator  resides.  There a vintage cannon rests on the well-manicured lawn near the flagpole from which the Union Jack flies.  <br><br>Behind the Residency is a 9-hole golf course.  Apparently a spare set of golf clubs at the Residency can be borrowed, and a certificate is issued to those who have played the course.  Blue TDC Golf Club ties were also sold as souvenirs on the island. <br><br>As I walked up the paved lane along the side of the Residency, I noticed a number of canvas sailboats which had been tied down there with ropes in order to prevent their being blown about by strong winds.  <br><br>My next stop was Prince Philip Hall, the community center.  The roof of this building was blown off during a hurricane which struck Edinburgh in May 2001.  Currently the school hall nearby is used for community gatherings.  <br><br>I walked through the paved lanes of the settlement past many small houses with lovely flowers in their gardens.  The most prominent of the flowers were the hydrangeas.  Strolling along, I was struck by the large number of automobiles parked in the driveways.  Most vehicles seemed to have 4-wheel drive capability, but I did notice one small sedan car too.  Painted bright red, it seemed a bit out of place.  There was also a farm tractor with a flatbed trailer in Edinburgh.<br><br>Then I crossed a small stream and struck out across a daisy-filled cow pasture toward the lava cone formed by the eruption which began in October 1961.  After climbing over a low lava rock wall and skirting a few inquisitive cows grazing in the fields, I hiked up along the grassy ravine adjacent to the volcanic cone, following some well-trodden cow paths.  About half way up I turned and took a photograph over the settlement.  <br><br>From my high vantage point I could also see Edinburgh's small water reservoir to my left at the base of the steep cliffs.  The water drunk on TDC is precipitation that has fallen high on the mountain in the form of rain or snow and has filtered down through the basalt, finally emanating from a spring near the settlement.  Those who have drunk TDC water say that it has a fine taste.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>PART TWO:<br><br>In January 2004 I enjoyed a unique cruise on the final voyage of the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS) round trip from Cape Town to the remote British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo.  <br><br>During my eight hours in TDC's only settlement, Edinburgh, which has a population of 285, I wandered into Jane's Café, the islands only restaurant, where I found a number of other RMS passengers enjoying drinks, sandwiches and dessert.  As crayfish (rock lobster) is the mainstay of TDCs economy, it was not surprising that crayfish sandwiches were sold at the café.  Chocolate sponge cake, beer and soft drinks were also available.  The proprietress took little notice of me as she continued her knitting.  A notice to the islands 285 residents posted on the cafe's bulletin board by the dental nurse warned that appointments for the upcoming dental visit had to be made at the hospital before 28 January 2004.  Outside Jane's Cafe were the only public W. C.s in Edinburgh.   <br><br>As I found the door unlocked, I photographed the interior of the empty Roman Catholic Church nearby.  Although I had passed the Rectory earlier, I never did find Edinburgh's Anglican Church which is said to contain an old photograph of Queen Victoria.<br><br>Continuing my walk, I passed Camogli Hospital.  The operating room and the X-ray machine in this facility suffered severe damage in a 2001 hurricane.  Nowadays from the outside one would never guess that the hurricane had caused one-quarter of the building to collapse. <br><br>At the far end of Edinburgh is a typical British bus stop sign.  Walking down the cement road beyond the sign, I found myself at the bottom of a steep, dry ravine.  In rainy times I imagined that this gulch must turn into a raging torrent of water, pushing boulders in its path.  The road was not paved across the floor of the gulch, but the cement did continue again up the far bank.  I continued to the top of the far embankment and saw a wide expanse of grassland ahead.  The paved road extended all the way beyond the grassy cinder cone in the distance to the Potato Patches which lie some 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away.  There islanders cultivate potatoes and other crops.  And I have read that on Friday afternoons a vehicle does in fact take residents from the Edinburgh bus stop to their ""weekend homes"" in the potato patches!   <br><br>Then I walked to the school on the opposite side of Edinburgh.  Along the way I took photographs of some of the settlement's dogs.  Though I passed many dogs today, not a single animal barked at me and only one even came up to sniff me.  In the school hall I purchased a first day cover from one of the women selling handicrafts and souvenirs.  I also made a donation to the headmistress for the school. <br><br>Beyond the school toward the lava flow lie three graveyards surrounded by low lava rock walls.  One graveyard is Anglican, another is Roman Catholic and a third is apparently for Freemasons.  All graves appeared to be well-tended and most were covered with cut flowers.  Outside the lava walls cows grazed lazily in the fields.<br><br>As I had heard that rockhopper penguins could sometimes be seen at Pigbite, the beach beyond the 1961 lava flow, I next wandered in that direction.  The half hour walk over the lava flow to a beach with large boulders revealed where TDC's outdated heavy equipment and various pieces of scrap metal had been junked.  This is also where TDC's garbage is burned.    <br><br>While I never did find any penguins, my walk over to the beach was an interesting one.  On the side of the road in the direction of Edinburgh I noticed huge fissures in the lava.  These fissures could only have been created by earthquakes.  Then when I reached the far side of the lava flow I saw a small waterfall created by a spring emanating from a point low on the cliff.  The wind was gusting strongly as I stepped over a small brook and began to walk across a grassy field.  There I was able to photograph a few skuas resting in a depression.  The large birds let me approach more closely than I had expected, but eventually they rose and floated away in the wind. <br><br>From the beach I returned to Edinburgh.  Realizing that I was hungry, I dropped into the local supermarket to purchase a small imported apple for eight pence.  The supermarket stocks many types of canned goods and dry goods plus frozen items and even handicrafts, including knitted sweaters.  While the fruit and vegetable department was nothing like back home, that was perfectly understandable, considering its location.  In general, though, I was surprised at just how much variety was available at the supermarket.  Adjacent to it were other stores selling plumbing and electrical goods.<br><br>In the early evening a final boat removed all passengers who wished to return to the RMS.  I often prefer to be one of the last persons to enter a small boat in order to avoid having to rock and roll while waiting for all the other passengers to board.  Consequently, because of my physical position in the boat, sometimes I am one of the first people to disembark.  <br><br>That was the case this time.  When I climbed the rope ladder up into the RMS, the small boat was sitting relatively still in the water.  But I had to hang around to wait for my backpack to be lifted up along with all the other loose passenger gear.  So I was in a good position to hear the horror stories told by those pale passengers who did not disembark until the very end.  Apparently shortly after I climbed the rope ladder the wind had shifted, causing the small boat to begin to flip around fairly violently.<br><br>What kind of person would ever consider taking a 13-day round trip cruise from Cape Town to TDC, you might wonder?  <br><br>The RMS passenger list included Jan and Kirsten, a Norwegian couple who seemed to specialize in traveling to obscure places.  Jan showed me his passport which even contained a visa for the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which surrounded by Azerbaijan.  This enclave is not on the Travelers' Century Club list and, interestingly, Jan and Kirsten had never even heard of the Travelers' Century Club.<br><br>TDC was the 286th Travelers' Century Club destination for George, a retired American doctor.  After Cape Town he planned to spend five days on Rodrigues Island, a dependency of Mauritius, before flying home to San Diego via the Kalahari and the Algarve.  George was finishing a five-month trip in fulfillment of his quest.  And, though we are fellow Travelers' Century Club members, George's quest was much more involved than my own.  In addition to traveling to all 317 world destinations on the Travelers' Century Club list, he was also trying to visit all of the world's major natural features such as deserts, etc.   <br><br>Richard, the only other American on board, planned to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway next year from Moscow to Vladivostok.  Like a surprising number of others on board, he was a repeat passenger on the RMS, having previously sailed to St. Helena and Ascension.<br><br>Walter, one of a number of Germans on the RMS, was the Hamburg-based producer of the German television crew.  He once spent a week filming on Jan Mayen Land, a Norwegian island situated between Spitzbergen and Iceland, and had also traveled to remote parts of Iran and Oman.  Incidentally, Walter, who once worked in Cairo as a journalist and is married to a Palestinian, was the only other Arabic speaker on board aside from myself.  <br><br>Stan, a retired professor of Canadian studies from Fredericton, NB, had been involved with philately since the age of six.  His interest in postal history led him to visit some stamp shops in Cape Town prior to the cruise in order to check out their covers.<br><br>Others, like South Africans James and Tara, booked at the last minute and benefited from a 50% fare discount.<br><br>John, a discriminating traveler from London, planned to take an 80-day round-the-world cruise on the Oriana next year.<br><br>There were five Swiss on the RMS.  Jean, Yves and Leopoldine, three friends from Geneva, were avid sailors who, in their younger days, used to sail their yacht around Europe at every opportunity.  Stefan, from Zurich, was an experienced and sophisticated traveler who had rented a house and car for a week-long holiday in a seaside suburb of Cape Town nearly every Northern Hemisphere winter for the last 15 years.  He confided that South Africa represented excellent value for the Swiss.  <br><br>Stefan's lively and inquisitive friend Yalgin, of Turkish extraction but with a Swiss passport, was interested in odd destinations.  Yalgin, who collected airline sickness bags, entertained us at dinner one night with stories about Busingen and Campione dal Italia, German and Italian enclaves in Switzerland, respectively, and about Samnaun, a Swiss town which must be accessed from Austria as no direct road connection exists with Switzerland.    <br><br>Dacre, a former pilot for British Airways and later, after retirement, with Singapore Airlines, and his wife Ann were booked on the RMS all the way north to Ascension.  Both spent their childhood years in Chile, where they met.  Dacre was fascinated by the controls on the bridge, and our captain took special pleasure in explaining the instruments to him.  Dacre collected old airline timetables, some of which are apparently very valuable.<br><br>The remaining passengers were mostly British but with a number of Germans and South Africans also in evidence.  Surprisingly, several elderly British were on the passenger list.  Some were traveling alone.  Eve mentioned that she had taken the RMS to St. Helena on another occasion and came along on this cruise to TDC as the captain had told her how interesting TDC was.<br><br>In spite of their varied travel experiences, most passengers felt that this cruise to Tristan da Cunha on the RMS St. Helena was a unique experience which they will remember for the rest of their lives. <br><br><BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",235
1,23,"""A Cruise to Some Little-Known Brazilian Islands: Fernando de Noronha and St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks,"" <BR>written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in May 2005<BR><BR> <P ><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Sx5fBNtPA""><FONT color=#006699 size=4>St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks, Brazilian equatorial islands, 33-second video clip </FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zRZxNdJdm8""><FONT color=#006699 size=4>Masked booby flying in the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, 120-second video clip </FONT></A></P><P ><BR>In March 2005 I sailed on the 382-passenger Silversea cruise ship MV <I>Silver Shadow</I> from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Lisbon, Portugal. In the Western Hemisphere my cruise ship was to call at the ports of Salvador and Natal in northeastern Brazil as well as the small Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha, which lies at latitude 3.85 S. and longitude 32.42 W., some 214 miles (345 km) off the coast of Brazil. In the Eastern Hemisphere my repositioning cruise was also to include calls at the following ports: Dakar, Senegal; Tenerife, Canary Islands; and Funchal, Madeira.<BR><BR>For the first six days the <I>Silver Shadow</I> kept to the published cruise itinerary. But on March 13 at 7 a.m. when the ship arrived at Fernando de Noronha we encountered a six-foot (two-meter) northeasterly swell. <BR><BR>The smaller Hapag-Lloyd cruise ship MV <I>Bremen</I>, which had been lying at anchor off Fernando de Noronha since the previous day, was able to disembark its passengers onto the island on the morning of March 13 via the fleet of inflatable Zodiacs which it carries on board. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, however, the six-foot (two-meter) swell was sufficient to prevent <I>Silver Shadow</I> passengers from disembarking safely into the ship's tenders or onto a trawler. Many of the ship's 284 passengers (the vessel was only three-quarters full) had signed up for three-hour ""Archipelago by Trawler"" excursions that were to have included an opportunity for swimming. These tours had to be cancelled. <BR><BR>Rather than commencing disembarkation procedures, the <I>Silver Shadow</I> instead made a two-hour counter-clockwise circumnavigation of the island. Captain Emanuele Chiesa also announced that, in consolation, he would deviate from the planned transatlantic route in order to view the seldom-visited mid-Atlantic rocks of St. Peter and St. Paul at about 9 a.m. on the morning of March 14. <BR><BR>Of course most passengers were disappointed not to be able to set foot on Fernando de Noronha. However, I had already flown to Fernando de Noronha in February 2001 prior to a previous cruise I had taken on MV <I>Silver Shadow</I> from Rio de Janeiro on Cape Town via Ascension and St. Helena in March 2001. So I was not as disturbed as were the other passengers; and, in fact, I welcomed the opportunity to trade a second visit to Fernando de Noronha for a chance to sail by and photograph St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks. <BR><BR>Originally called Ilha da Quaresma, or Lent Island, Fernando de Noronha was probably first sighted by the Portuguese expedition to Brazil led by Fernao de Loronha in 1501-1502. However, as Amerigo Vespucci, who traveled to Brazil with a Portuguese expedition in 1503, was the first person to describe the archipelago, he is often credited with its discovery.<BR><BR>Between 1534 and 1737 Fernando de Noronha changed hands between the English, French, Dutch and Portuguese a number of times. Finally in about 1770 Vila dos Remedios, the first permanent Portuguese settlement, was established. Brazil's independence in the nineteenth century had little impact on the archipelago. In the first half of the twentieth century the English, the French and the Italians all had some involvement with the island in connection with transatlantic cable communications. The island also served as a prison for many years.<BR><BR>The U. S. built an airfield on Fernando de Noronha during World War II. This was one of a chain of airfields which stretched from Florida all the way to Egypt via South America and Central Africa. Aircraft were flown from the U. S. to North Africa by this circuitous route in order to support the Allied war effort. U. S. troops remained on the island from 1942 to 1945. Later, NASA maintained a missile tracking station there from 1957 to 1962. <BR><BR>Of the 21 islands in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, only the main island is inhabited. The total land area of the archipelago is 10 square miles (26 square km); and the highest peak, Morro do Pico, reaches 1,053 feet (321 meters). There is a permanent population of about 1,300. The few historical sites of interest to the tourist include a Portuguese-built fort and a church in the hamlet of Vila dos Remedios. Nowadays there is daily air service to Fernando de Noronha (airport code FEN) from Recife, Brazil via Boeing 737 jet. <BR><BR>During the five centuries since its discovery, some 95% of Fernando de Noronha's native vegetation and trees was destroyed. The marine national park which was declared in 1989 set aside about 70% of the archipelago as a sanctuary. Today Fernando de Noronha is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to the existence of the marine national park, cruise ships such as <I>Silver Shadow</I> now can only lie at anchor off the northwest coast of the island. <BR><BR>No more than 480 tourists are allowed on the island at any one time. An environmental preservation tax is imposed on island visitors by the state government. Interestingly, this tax escalates the longer one remains on the island! <BR><BR>With an average annual water temperature of 75 F. (24 C.) and underwater visibility of up to 131 feet (40 meters), diving has become Fernando de Noronha's primary tourist attraction. The archipelago boasts white sandy beaches lapped by waters untainted by silt from Brazilian rivers. There are 230 species of fish and 15 varieties of coral in the archipelago. Dolphins, stingrays, whales, five types of sharks and two species of marine tortoise all inhabit the archipelago. <BR><BR>Twenty-four species of marine birds are also to be found. I was captivated by the scores of masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) which followed the <I>Silver Shadow</I> on March 13 as the ship circumnavigated and then sailed away from Fernando de Noronha. <BR><BR>The family Sulidae contains nine species of boobies and gannets. Both boobies and gannets are conspicuous at sea due to their large size, high flight and spectacular diving habits. Both boobies and gannets have long pointed bills, webbed feet and pointed wings. Although resembling a gannet superficially, the masked booby's head is completely white and the coloration resembles a black face mask. In addition, the masked booby is broader than the gannet, and there is a more extensive trailing edge to the wings of the former. <BR><BR>Early mariners, who found that boobies exhibited no fear of humans, killed them easily for food. Because these birds appeared tame, they were called boobies after the Spanish word bobo which means ""stupid."" <BR><BR>With a length of 34 inches (86 cm) and a width of 60 inches (152 cm), the masked booby is the largest and heaviest of the boobies. According to the <U>National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region</U> by John Bull and John Farrand, Jr., published in New York in 1994 by Alfred A. Knopf, the masked booby is ""a stocky white seabird with a black tail, black tips and trailing edges to the wings."" It bears a pinkish or orange bill; and during the breeding season the booby exhibits a patch of bare, bluish skin at the base of the bill. <BR><BR>Preferring deep water for fishing, the booby executes near-vertical plunge-dives in search of flying fish and/or squid. In fact, boobies are seldom found in regions where flying fish and squid are not plentiful. I found that a booby would often let out a squawk similar to that of a duck prior to plunging deep into the Atlantic as if it were a vertical torpedo. Other boobies, upon hearing the squawking, would plunge into the ocean nearby. Peter Harrison in <U>Seabirds of the World A Photographic Guide</U>, published in London in 1996 by Christopher Helm Ltd., mentions that the masked booby, which is pantropical, is a colonial breeder on islands, including the south Atlantic islands of Fernando de Noronha and Ascension Island where it normally lays two chalky, pale blue eggs in a shallow depression.<BR><BR><U>The Field Guide to the Birds of North America</U>, third edition, published in Washington, DC in 1999 by the National Geographic Society, points out that the masked booby breeds as far north as Florida's Dry Tortugas. This booby is also sighted rarely in the Gulf Stream as far north as the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The bird is seen only occasionally in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer. The masked booby is loosely gregarious at sea but is said not to follow ships usually. In fact, the many masked boobies which accompanied us on March 13 were no longer in evidence the following day. <BR><BR>At 9 a.m. on March 14 the <I>Silver Shadow</I> arrived one mile (1.6 km) off St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks, which lie at latitude 0.93 N. and longitude 29.35 W., more than 496 miles (800 km) off the coast of Brazil. These equatorial Brazilian islands, composed of mylonitic peridotite, are of volcanic origin. The island group, some 820 feet (250 meters) wide and with a maximum height of 64 feet (19.5 meters), is the peak of a submarine mountain which extends 13,123 feet (4,000 meters) down to the sea bed below. <BR><BR>St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks are of interest primarily because they are so far offshore in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These isolated islands represent one of the very few places where a mid-oceanic ridge attains a height which is above sea level. In effect, these mid-Atlantic rocks serve as an oasis for marine life within an otherwise deep water environment. <BR><BR>There is no source of fresh water on the rocks other than rain, and the islands themselves are devoid of vegetation with the exception of two types of algae. But the marine flora and fauna provide a significant food source for the seabirds which reside and breed there. A 1971 biological survey by Smith et al.* showed that the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the brown noddy (Anous stolidus) and the black noddy (Anous minutus) all breed on these rocks and that these birds' eggs are sometimes eaten by crabs (Grapsus grapsus), which occur there in large numbers. Incidentally, all three of these birds are also said to breed on Ascension Island.<BR><BR>While it appears that scientists, amateur radio enthusiasts and Brazilian military personnel may have been the only visitors to St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks in recent years, interestingly, these isolated islands were also visited by Charles Darwin in HMS <I>Beagle</I> in 1860 and by H. N. Moseley in HMS <I>Challenger</I> in 1879. Both naturalists reported seeing vast numbers of sea birds during those nineteenth century calls. However, multitudes of sea birds are no longer in evidence today. This may be due to human interference on the islands. A lighthouse, a radio tower, a house and a shed have been constructed on one of the islands. There is also a wooden stairway running down to a small dock area. <BR><BR>The decline in bird life may also be due to extensive fishing in the area by boats from Brazil. During my short visit I spotted three fishing boats working off these rocks. Captain Chiese of the <I>Silver Shadow</I> remarked that he was surprised to see such small fishing boats operating so far from the continent of South America.<BR><BR>* Additional internet reference used in preparation of this article: <BR><U><A href=""http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/nt/nt1318_full.html"" eudora=""autourl""> www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/nt/nt1318_full.html<BR></FONT> </A></U><BR></P> <P ><BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",233

HELENA ISLAND:<BR><BR>""St. Helena Sightseeing and a Surprise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2006 </P><P>With Captain Christopher Turner at the helm, Holland America Line's elegant MS <I>Prinsendam</I> slowly approached the anchorage in James Bay off the north coast of the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic on the morning of 14 November 2006 after a 66-hour crossing from Luderitz, Namibia. As it eased to a stop and dropped anchor, the 38,000-ton <I>Prinsendam</I> passed the much smaller, 6,700-ton RMS <I>St. Helena</I>, which already lay at anchor closer to shore. The royal mail ship is the only vessel which regularly links the British overseas territories of St. Helena and Ascension with Walvis Bay, Namibia and Cape Town. <BR><BR>Discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese navigator Joao da Nova and briefly occupied twice by the Dutch during the seventeenth century, St. Helena has been in English possession continuously since 1673. At that time the English East India Company used the island as a stop on the voyage to India via the Cape of Good Hope. In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte was brought to St. Helena and detained there until his death in 1821. The island was also used for the detention of some 5,000 Boer prisoners during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. The economy of St. Helena prospered when the island was used as a port of call for ships plying the route to India and the Cape Colonies. However, the construction of the Suez Canal reduced the frequency of such long sea voyages. Since World War II the prosperity of the island has continued to decrease. However, there are now plans afoot to build an airport on St. Helena in order to help boost the island's economy. Currently it is hoped that the new airport will open by 2012. <BR><BR>At 10 a.m. the <I>Prinsendam</I>, Holland America's oldest (built in 1988) and smallest (793 passengers) liner, commenced tender operations from the ship to the Jamestown wharf. Our touring party that day consisted of a dozen Americans. Most members of our group had embarked in Lisbon on 17 October for the entire 46-day ""Taste of Two Continents"" cruise to Ft. Lauderdale via Cape Town. Prior to St. Helena the <I>Prinsendam</I> had called at a dozen ports in ten African countries from Morocco to South Africa. <BR><BR>After stepping ashore at the Jamestown pier our party was met by Tracey Corker. Tracey and her amiable father Colin operate Corkers Tourist Services. Colin's father had imported one of the first vehicles into St. Helena in the early 1930s. That 1929 Chevrolet Charrabanc, an open touring car which had been manufactured for export in the U. S. with right-hand drive, is still in good running order today; and it can hold up to 16 passengers. Our party had pre-arranged a full-day island tour in Colin's unique green car which is well known on the island. Colin's father had installed a convertible cover for use in rainy weather. The occasional heavy mist we experienced in the uplands that day, said to be unusual for St. Helena in late spring, made use of the convertible cover necessary for awhile. <BR><BR>Our St. Helena sightseeing tour began with a group photo in the Chevy Charrabanc on Main Street in Jamestown. Then, with Colin at the wheel, we proceeded to drive up Side Path, the steep single-lane switchback road carved into the eastern side of the narrow ravine in which Jamestown is located. Colin kept the throttle in low gear for the entire uphill climb as the road rises nearly 600 meters (2,000 feet) in only about 3 km (2 miles). <BR><BR>Our first lengthy stop was made about half an hour later near Napoleon's fenced but inscriptionless tomb. After a 10-minute walk down a wide path we reached the spot at the head of Sane Valley where Napoleon had originally been interred at his death in 1821 after six years in residence on the island. Napoleon's remains were removed to Paris in 1840. I found that the tomb site had been much improved since my first visit to St. Helena in March 2001. Whereas previously a simple grassy area had surrounded the tomb, now there is a well-manicured garden off to one side. The French tricolor continues to fly from a short flagpole near the guard's kiosk. This spot and Longwood House, our next stop, were ceded to France in 1858. <BR><BR>The grounds of Longwood House, Napoleon's residence on St. Helena, were as beautiful as ever. Napoleon's sunken garden pathways, on which he could stroll without being seen from afar, remain in evidence. However, I found that Longwood House had been changed in one important respect since my last visit. While the entrance on the east side of the building is unchanged, the exit is no longer through the long green trellis on the same side. Now visitors can only leave via a gift shop on the north side of the house. The gift shop, which bears the sign of Hutt's Gate Store on the wall behind the counter, offers every sort of Napoleon-related souvenir imaginable, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. But, since Longwood House still has no entrance fee, one can hardly complain. Non-flash photography is allowed in the house but video photography is not. <BR><BR>From Longwood House we returned back to the island's circular road. En route we passed Hutt's Gate Store. Once an inn frequented by Napoleon's guards, Colin mentioned that currently the store is up for auction. <BR><BR>The interior one-third of St. Helena is foliated and resembles England. Southeast trade winds carry mists which shroud the highest slopes and help create lush uplands. During our tour around the island Colin pointed out a couple of disused flax mills. The flax industry was established on St. Helena in the early years of the twentieth century. New Zealand flax, said to grow best on St. Helena's highest ground, was baled and exported to England and South Africa where it was made into hemp. However, the flax industry collapsed in the mid-1960s when the British General Post Office began to employ nylon rather than hemp manufactured from St. Helena-grown flax. <BR> <BR>As the afternoon wore on, our party paused en route at the Solomon & Co. shop at Silver Hill for some refreshments of candy and cookies. Fifteen minutes later we passed Sandy Bay, which forms part of a large sunken crater. Unfortunately foggy conditions made it difficult to discern Lot and Lot's Wife, two giant basalt pillars which jut up from the lunar landscape in the south of the island. The beautiful vistas of the blue sea beyond the island's arid coast were also obscured by the fog and mist. During our tour Colin pointed out three new senior citizens' residences which have been constructed by the government in recent years at various places around the island. <BR><BR>Later we passed St. Paul's Cathedral. St. Helena is a bishopric in the province of the Church of South Africa, and most of St. Helena's remaining inhabitants are Anglican. Since winning the right of abode in the United Kingdom the island's population has shrunk somewhat. Colin thought that the current population is probably in the range of 3,500 whereas St. Helena's population had been as high as 6,000 in the past.<br><br>Our next stop was at Plantation House, the home of St. Helena 's governors since 1792.  While it is thought that several other houses preceded the current house, the locations of these earlier houses are unknown.  The first such governor's house may have been built of wood as early as 1673.  The present site of Plantation House was provided by the East India Company. <br><br>Plantation House's Georgian facade faces onto a wide fenced lawn which is home to at least five giant tortoises ranging in weight from 55 kg. (121 pounds) to approximately 200 kg. (440 pounds).  We photographed Jonathan, the Seychelles tortoise who was brought to St. Helena as a mature adult in 1882.  Based on the assumption that a tortoise is mature when it is about 50 years of age, Jonathan's current age has been estimated at approximately 174.  Jonathan is said to be the oldest known member of his species, Testudinipae cytodira .  Jonathan lives on the grounds along with David, Emma, Fredricka andMyrtle.  These other four giant tortoises have joined Jonathan on the lawn of Plantation House only since the late 1960s.  While occasionally eggs are laid by the female tortoises, none has ever produced offspring. <br><br>From Plantation House we drove down to the Jamestown suburb long known at Half Tree Hollow.  Colin mentioned that nowadays locals most often refer to this area as Three Tanks after the three red water tanks currently in use there.  From that point we continued down to Ladder Hill in order to photograph Jamestown far below.  Jacob's Ladder, with 699 almost-vertical steps, is said to be the longest staircase in the world.  It was built by the Royal Engineers in 1829 to link Jamestown with High Knoll Fort, situated on the cliff above. <br><br>Our party's island tour concluded in front of the post office on Main Street in Jamestown; and it was there and then that I had long planned a special surprise for Barbara Stein, my significant other of nine years.  Barbara and I have considered ourselves a couple almost since we met when we sat next to each other on a bus during a travel agents' tour of Iran in 1997.  As avid and frequent travelers to exotic places, Barbara and I have often joked privately of marrying at the South Pole.  But we both knew that in reality only a winning lottery ticket ever would have made that possible.  We also knew that, because a wedding far from the U. S. would make it difficult for friends and family to attend, South Florida is the most logical place for the wedding itself.  <br><br>During the spring of 2006 it occurred to me that the only way to add an exotic geographical component to our marriage would be for me to propose to Barbara at some distant locale.  Since our Holland America Lisbon-to-Ft. Lauderdale cruise via Cape Town had been anticipated since mid-2005, I determined to propose to Barbara on November 14 on the steps of the main post office in Jamestown.  Because I wanted to surprise her, I told Barbara nothing about the engagement ring I had made for her in Cairo in the summer of 2006.  However, I did inform our friends who were to tour with us in St . Helena.  Unbeknownst to me, they proceeded to purchase and then sneak two bottles of champagne, plastic cups, and confetti along on the tour that day.   <br><br>At the end of our island tour I assembled our party of 12 for a group photo on the steps of the Jamestown post office.  Afterward I employed the ruse of asking Barbara to pose with me for a separate photo in order to separate her from the rest of the group.  It was then that I got down on my knee on the step of the post office and slipped an alexandrite engagement ring onto her finger, asking if she would marry me in November 2007.  Uncharacteristically, a flabbergasted Barbara appeared to find herself at a complete loss for words.  However, she soon gave me a positive response; and then bubbly was poured for all.  As it was late in the day and there were no customers, even the three ladies working in the main post office, all of whom had been watching from behind the counter inside, joined us in celebrating! <br><br>Before leaving the premises I posted a couple of dozen postcards at the post office.  I was told that my cards would be carried on the RMS St. Helena , which was scheduled to depart on 15 November for Cape Town.  A notice outside the post office cautioned that 14 November was the deadline for posting surface mail to the U. K. before Christmas. <br><br>For the convenience of cruise passengers, on 16 November the St. Helena Development Agency sponsored a trade fair.  Over a dozen vendors set up stands in the small park between the moat and the side of the Castle, just to the east of the Archway at the entrance to Jamestown.  Items offered for sale included the following:  locally-produced Tungi wine; locally-grown coffee; canned tuna fish from the St. Helena Cannery; embroidery and crocheted articles; tea towels; shoulder bags; shopping bags; aprons; T-shirts; caps; mugs; calendars; cookbooks; jams; pressed flower pictures; woodcraft items; post cards; a DVD about the island; and a CD by a local artist. <br><br>After our eight-hour call at St. Helena the Prinsendam continued on to Ascension Island and four Brazilian ports plus Barbados and the Bahamas before finishing the cruise in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  Unfortunately on 16 November a heavy swell and strong winds made tendering into Georgetown too dangerous.  So instead Captain Turner elected to circumnavigate Ascension before MS Prinsendam proceeded on the 73-hour passage to Fortaleza, Brazil. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",232

In addition, due to the wildlife migration in the Serengeti, from October through early July there is more game in </SPAN> <SPAN >Serengeti National Park</SPAN> <SPAN >, </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >'s share of the </SPAN> <SPAN >Serengeti Plain</SPAN> <SPAN >, than there is in </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Masai</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Mara</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >National Park</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >, which is the northern tip of the Serengeti lying in </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN >.<BR><BR>While the game species to be seen in northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > and southern </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN > are similar, there is one overwhelming reason for choosing </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > for one's safari; and that is Ngorongoro Crater, which is unique in having a captive wildlife population year-round. The remnant of a collapsed volcano which may have rivaled Kilimanjaro in height, the crater is between 16 km and 19 km wide and has an area of 265 square km. The rim of Ngorongoro Crater lies 610 meters above the crater floor. Some 30,000 animals live in the crater, including lion, elephant, buffalo, Thompson's gazelle, wildebeest and zebra. The best seasons for visiting Ngorongoro Crater are December-February and June-July. <BR><BR>The other popular game reserves on northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >'s safari circuit are </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Serengeti</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >National Park</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >, </SPAN> <st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Lake</SPAN></st1:PlaceType><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Manyara</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> <SPAN > and, to a lesser extent, </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Tarangire</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >National Park</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >. <BR><BR>Serengeti, established in 1951, is the second largest (after Selou) but most famous of </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >'s national parks. Serengeti is best known for the annual migration which occurs across its plains. This phenomenon involves many thousands of game animals. <BR><BR>The major attraction of </SPAN> <st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Lake</SPAN></st1:PlaceType><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Manyara</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> <SPAN >, established in 1960 and lying in the </SPAN> <SPAN >Great Rift Valley</SPAN> <SPAN >, is its lions which sleep in the trees! While not everyone is lucky enough to witness this, Manyara is rich enough in elephants, hippos, plains game and bird life that no tourist is likely to go away complaining. <BR><BR>The best time to visit the much less-touristed Tarangire, established in 1970, is during the dry season from July to September. During that time the game is heavily concentrated along the river for which the park is named.<BR><BR><BR><B>WHY TAKE A SAFARI IN </B></SPAN> <B><SPAN >KENYA</SPAN></B> <B><SPAN > RATHER THAN IN </SPAN></B> <B><SPAN >NORTHERN TANZANIA</SPAN></B> <B><SPAN >?<BR></SPAN></B><SPAN ><BR>If a safari will fall in the period from late July until October, then the best game viewing experience is quite likely to be in </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN >'s </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Masai</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Mara</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >National Park</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN > where the wildebeest migration is then massed. <BR><BR>Those taking a safari in </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN > or in northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > generally fly from </SPAN> <SPAN >Cairo</SPAN> <SPAN > directly to </SPAN> <SPAN >Nairobi</SPAN> <SPAN >'s </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Jomo</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Kenyatta</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >International</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Airport</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >. There is an inexpensive shuttle bus service which carries passengers daily from downtown </SPAN> <SPAN >Nairobi</SPAN> <SPAN > to </SPAN> <SPAN >Arusha</SPAN> <SPAN >, </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >. The shuttle bus takes about five hours each way. It is from Arusha that safaris in northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > actually begin. If a safari is taken in </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN > rather than in </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >, some ten hours of shuttle bus riding can be avoided. <BR><BR>Although Ethiopian Airlines flies from </SPAN> <SPAN >Cairo</SPAN> <SPAN > to </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Kilimanjaro</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >International</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Airport</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >, about an hour west of Arusha, air schedules usually necessitate an overnight in </SPAN> <SPAN >Addis Ababa</SPAN> <SPAN >. For travelers who would like to spend a day or so in the Ethiopian capital, this might have some appeal. But for those who just want to get to their </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > safari as efficiently as possible, a Kenya Airways or Egypt Air flight to </SPAN> <SPAN >Nairobi</SPAN> <SPAN > will be the first choice, followed by the five-hour shuttle ride from </SPAN> <SPAN >Nairobi</SPAN> <SPAN > to Arusha. <BR><BR>The quality of the asphalt surfacing on </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN >'s road network deteriorates rapidly the farther away from </SPAN> <SPAN >Nairobi</SPAN> <SPAN > one travels; and in general </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN >'s roads are not that great. However, the roads in </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > are even worse. Since the mid-1990s the quality of northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN >'s road network, which was not as good as </SPAN> <SPAN >Kenya</SPAN> <SPAN >'s to begin with, has deteriorated even further. Now it is recommended that those who can afford it drive the northern </SPAN> <SPAN >Tanzania</SPAN> <SPAN > safari circuit one way only (from Arusha via </SPAN> <st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Lake</SPAN></st1:PlaceType><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Manyara</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> <SPAN > and Ngorongoro Crater to Serengeti) and then fly back from Serengeti to Arusha.

4,23,"""<b>A Long Weekend Escape to Venezuela's Angel Falls</b>,"" written for the   expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2009  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br>  <span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"">Early one   Friday in September 2008 my fiance Barbara and I flew American Airlines from   Miami via San Juan, Puerto Rico to Caracas, Venezuela.  We had arranged to   rendezvous at Caracas Airport with two friends who had been traveling in South   America earlier in the week.  On Friday and Saturday nights all four of us   stayed at a comfortable hotel in downtown Caracas.  <br>  <br>  Early on Saturday morning we all flew an Aserca Airlines DC-9 from Caracas to   Puerto Ordaz, a major industrial port situated on the Orinoco River in eastern   Venezuela.  From there we connected south immediately on a 12-passenger single   prop Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft to make two passes by 3,212-foot-high   (979-meter-high) Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall.  <br>  <br>  As you might imagine, the bottom of Angel Falls, which is a staggering 15   times higher than Niagara Falls, was obscured by clouds.  However, we could   clearly see and photograph the top of the falls, with the water falling off   the magnificent tepui (plateau) into the clouds below!  <br>  <br>  After flying by Angel Falls, we landed on the paved air strip at the nearby   hamlet of Canaima.  There we were given a ride on a motorized canoe to visit   some other, much smaller but very picturesque waterfalls.  After a wonderful   lunch at a tourist lodge, we returned to the Canaima Airport to fly in a   10-passenger twin prop aircraft to Puerto Ordaz.  After a three-hour layover   there we returned on the same Aserca Airlines DC-9 aircraft back to Caracas.   <br>  <br>  Finally, on Sunday morning Barbara and I flew American Airlines nonstop from   Caracas to Miami.  It was a wonderful long weekend adventure, and Angel Falls   was truly a wonderful spectacle to behold!<br>  <br>  PRACTICALITIES:<br>  <br>  Angel Falls is 450 miles (725 km) southeast of Caracas.  The best time to   visit is during the wet season, between May and November.  During these months   the water volume is greatest.  However, frustratingly, that is also when   visibility can be the worst!<br>  <br>  For general information on Angels Falls, visit  <a style=""color: blue;

The Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, redeveloped in the late 1980s, includes luxury hotels and a lively mall with expensive shops and restaurants which are frequented by both tourists and local residents alike. Nearby is the Two Oceans Aquarium featuring creatures unique to this area near the confluence of the </SPAN> Atlantic</SPAN> and </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Indian</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Oceans</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> . Catamarans depart from the V & A Waterfront to </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Robben</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Island</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> where one can view the very cell in which Nelson Mandela was long incarcerated. The tours, led by former prisoners, often prove to be a very emotional experience. As a bonus, fairy penguins are sometimes glimpsed resting comfortably on </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Robben</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Island</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> under the bushes near the catamaran dock.<BR><BR></SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Table</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Mountain</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> itself is easily accessible by revolving cableway. However, queues for the cableway can be long. Also, operation of the cableway is stopped whenever there are high winds. Interestingly, tourists in a sometimes windless City Bowl may not be aware that strong winds atop </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Table</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Mountain</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> have forced the cableway to close. Therefore one should ring the cableway to check if it is operating before hopping a bus or taxi to the lower cableway station.<BR><BR>Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens, southeast of </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Table</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Mountain</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> , contains some 4,500 floral species. This is a lovely venue for a picnic or, for the more adventurous, a hike on the slopes of </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Table</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Mountain</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> .<BR><BR>A day trip to Cape Point in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve should begin with a stop at Boulders Beach, just south of Simon's Town, the naval port facing east onto False Bay. The penguin colony there is one of only a very few mainland colonies in the world. <BR><BR>Continuing south and entering the nature reserve, one finds other vehicles slowing and stopping to watch the </SPAN> Cape</SPAN> baboons which boldly clamber onto the cars, begging for food. At Cape Point, the southwesternmost point in </SPAN> Africa</SPAN> , the scenery is remarkably rugged; and the winds can be fierce. A 15-minute hike takes tourists up to the lighthouse. Or, for those who may not be in a hiking mood, a very short funicular railway is also available. For a nominal fee, tourists may pose for a digital photo which is then e-mailed by the photographer as an attachment to a friend back home. <BR><BR>The other ""must do"" day trip from </SPAN> Cape Town</SPAN> is to the Winelands. Wine has been grown in this region for over three centuries. Winelands tours generally include visits to wineries in Stellenbosch, Franschhoek and/or Paarl. But even those who don't drink wine will still enjoy a delightful day, feasting their eyes on some of the beautifully-restored old mansions which are treasures of </SPAN> <st1:PlaceType>Cape</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> </SPAN><st1:PlaceName>Dutch</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> architecture. The Winelands offer gorgeous, green grassy landscapes and panoramas with mountains behind. In addition, there are interesting museums nearby.<BR><BR>Hermanus, the self-proclaimed whale capital of the world some 80 km from </SPAN> Cape Town</SPAN> , celebrates the return of the southern right whales each autumn with the Hermanus Whale Festival which is staged in late September and early October. About 1,000 of these large mammals are thought to swim in the waters off the coast of </SPAN> South Africa</SPAN> .<BR><BR>Cape Town is also the jumping-off point for the Garden Route, a scenic coastal drive stretching east from Mossel Bay some 250 km, as far as Storms River in the Tsitsikamina National Park. One can rent a car in </SPAN> Cape Town</SPAN> and drive to the </SPAN><st1:Street><st1:address>Garden Route</SPAN></st1:address></st1:Street> via Outshoorn where ostriches are farmed. The rental car can then be returned in George or </SPAN> Port Elizabeth</SPAN> . From either of these cities it is possible to fly back to </SPAN> Cairo</SPAN> via </SPAN> Johannesburg</SPAN> . <BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES: <BR></B><BR>The best time to visit </SPAN> Cape Town</SPAN> is from October to March -- that is, before, during, or after the Southern Hemisphere summer. During this time of year it is dry and the days are longer. Only 0.6 mm of rain falls per month in January and February, the driest months. During December, the warmest month, the average daily low is 20 C. (68 F.) and the average daily high climbs to 27 C. (80 F.).<BR><BR>However, those considering a visit in December or January would do well to reserve far in advance. Bookings during this school holiday period are normally heavy due to the fact that most tourists in </SPAN> South Africa</SPAN> are in fact locals! <BR><BR>Those who must plan their visit between June and August, the Northern Hemisphere summer, should not fret as </SPAN> Cape Town</SPAN> is worthy of a visit in any season. The mother city's rainiest month is June, with only 93 mm; and the coldest month is July, when the average daily low is a moderate 7 C. (44 F.) and the average daily high reaches 17 C. (62 F.).<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br></P><P >---------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""Bushman's Kloof, A Most Unique Resort in South Africa,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt in September 2007 </P><P ><BR>Where can you combine the viewing of 10,000-year-old Bushman rock art and safari game drives while enjoying luxurious accommodation, excellent dining and a spa, all in a single majestic wilderness reserve? <BR><BR>The unique Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve and Retreat, situated in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa's Western Cape Province only 3 1/2 hours northeast of Cape Town, offers all this and more!<BR><BR>Over 130 sites with Bushman rock art are located within Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve. Experienced rangers offer guided walks along rivers and across the veld to view these sites, some of which are among the oldest recorded examples of human art. En route guests can witness the scenic beauty of the foothills of the Cederberg Mountains. Waterfalls, rivers and clear rock pools are set against sandstone sculpted by the winds of many millenia. <BR><BR>Bushmans Kloof boasts 35 species of mammals and 150 species of birds. While there are no large predators on the property, the reserve does offer, for example, gemsbok, Cape Mountain zebra, eland, red hartebeest, springbok and black wildebeest. In addition, occasionally it is possible to see bat-eared fox, Cape fox, porcupine, aardwolf and African wildcat. Birds include malachite kingfisher, black harrier and African fish eagle. Night game drives provide an opportunity to view both the various nocturnal species and the magnificent night sky. <BR><BR>Within the reserve there are over 750 indigenous plant species. In fact, the veld bursts with color between July and October as the spring flowers blossom. Those guests who may wish to explore the outdoors further will enjoy hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, canoeing, fly fishing, archery and even painting! <br><br>The retreat's 16 rooms will accommodate a total of 32 guests.  All rooms feature separate bath and shower and also a private patio.  Some of the deluxe rooms also include a fireplace.  All rooms are air-conditioned and have both under-floor heating and a ceiling fan. <br><br>The facilities at Bushmans Kloof include the Homestead and the Heritage Center.  The Homestead contains two lounge areas, one of which has a satellite flat screen television.  There is also an extensive book and DVD library plus a heated outdoor pool and a gym.  In the Heritage Center are San Bushman artifacts such as jewelry, dolls and dancing sticks plus a collection of photographs which show the day-to-day lives of these nomads.  Rangers give talks in the Heritage Center about various aspects of the reserve. <br><br>Other facilities include:  a medicinal herb garden which contains plants used by the San nomads to cure various illnesses; a colorful flower garden which yields a number of different scents; and an organic fruit and vegetable garden, the produce of which is consumed at the resort.  Finally, the very interesting gift shop contains a variety of items created by some of the finest artisans in South Africa. <br><br>Guests are treated to a profusion of gastronomic creations made from produce harvested daily from organically-cultivated gardens.  Aside from various indoor and open-air dining venues at the retreat itself, arrangements can also be made to dine at several breathtaking and romantic locations around the reserve. <br><br>Finally, up-market Bushmans Kloof is the ultimate venue for a wedding or a honeymoon.  The ceremony and reception can be arranged either indoors or under African skies.  What better location to begin a lifetime of memories together? <br><br>Bushmans Kloof is malaria-free.  During the South African summer from November to March a hat, sunglasses, sunblock and a swimsuit are recommended.  Temperatures range from a high of 40 C./104 F. to a low of 20 C./68 F. during this period.  During the South African winter from June to August warm clothing is required.  Then scarves, gloves, hats and warm jackets are useful during evening nature drives.  Temperatures range from a high of 25 C./77 F. to a low of 0 C./32 F.  During April, May, September and October temperatures range from a high of 30 C./86 F. to a low of 10 C./50 F.  Casual dress is appropriate all year long.  Bring comfortable shoes, a camera and binoculars. <br><br>Guests at unique Bushmans Kloof can get close to nature in comfort in a land where our ancestors lived thousands of years ago.  Anyone for a safari with a twist?<br><br>PRACTICALITIES:  Nowadays Cape Town can be reached using many airlines via Johannesburg.  Egypt Air is the only air carrier which flies nonstop from Cairo to Johannesburg.  Travelers flying on any other airline will also change planes at that airline's hub, i. e. Nairobi for Kenya Airways, Addis Ababa for Ethiopian Airlines, Dubai for Emirates, Doha for Qatar Airways, etc.  The 270 km/167-mile-drive from Cape Town to Bushmans Kloof is scenic, and the route is asphalt all the way except for the final 20 km/12 miles which is a good quality gravel road.  Transfers from Cape Town by road or by air can be arranged for those who would prefer not to rent a car.<br><br><BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",416
6,23,"""Utah's Five National Parks,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in January 2008 <BR><BR> Utah bills itself as ""America's national parks capital"" in spite of the fact that it possesses fewer national parks than California! Perhaps this is because southern Utah has the greatest concentration of national parks of any U. S. state. Although the very large state of California contains eight national parks while Utah has only five, California's national parks are very widely dispersed. On the other hand, all five of Utah's national parks - Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Arches and Canyonlands - are situated fairly close to one another in the southern part of the state. <BR><BR>This proximity makes it convenient for tourists to visit all five parks in a single trip. Las Vegas, Nevada's McCarran Airport, the world's eleventh busiest, provides a convenient starting and ending point for a circle trip to see southern Utah's amazing natural wonders. Such a round-trip drive could be accomplished in as little as four days. A bonus on the return drive is the north rim of the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona.<BR><BR>Spring and autumn are the best times to visit the national parks in Utah. However, for those unable to avoid the extreme heat and crowds of summer or the frost and snow of winter, Utah's national parks remain open year-round. <BR><BR>Three of Utah's national parks are among the best the U. S. has to offer. Zion, Bryce Canyon and Arches are the state's largest tourist attractions, accounting for more than 18 million tourists annually. The other two parks, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands, are much less visited.<BR><BR>235-square-mile (595-square-km) Zion National Park, established in 1919, is known for its impressive cliffs and monolithic rocks. The highlight is 2,400-foot-deep (732-meter-deep) Zion Canyon. In order to eliminate extreme automobile congestion during the summer months, since 2000 the National Park Service has required visitors to ride a shuttle bus along the 6-mile-long (10-km-long) Zion Canyon Scenic Drive which follows the beautiful north fork of the Virgin River. Elevations in the park range from 3,666 feet (1,117 meters) to a mountaintop height of 8,726 feet (2,660 meters). The Kolob Canyons section in the northwestern part of Zion is also well worth a visit. There a much less-visited 5-mile (8-km) drive provides spectacular overlooks of the Finger Canyons. <BR><BR>58-square-mile (146-square-km) Bryce Canyon National Park, originally set aside as a national monument in 1923, consists of a series of amphitheatres formed from pink-colored cliffs. The eroded soft limestone in this area has created a maze of rock spires which radiate warm hues of reds and yellows. These unique geological features originated some 60 million years ago. An 18-mile (29-km) scenic drive south from the 8,000-foot-high (2,438-meter-high) visitor center takes visitors past a number of overlooks. The drive, along which a non-mandatory shuttle bus operates, culminates at Rainbow Point at an altitude of 9,100 feet (2,774 meters). <BR><BR>122-square-mile (310-square-km) Arches National Park, a portion of which was originally set aside as a national monument in 1929, contains over 1,500 arches, many of which are visible from the 18-mile (29-km) paved scenic drive or after a short hike. Elevations in the park range from 3,960 feet (1,207 meters) up to 5,653 feet (1,723 meters). <BR><BR>Capitol Reef National Park boasts beautifully-colored rock formations and impressive cliffs. Parts of this 387-square-mile (979-square km) park were set aside originally as a national monument in 1937. The central feature of Capitol Reef is 1,100-mile-long (1,770-km-long) Waterpocket Fold, whose origin dates back some 70 million years. Visitors often wonder about the origin of the park's name. Early explorers, who found Waterpocket Fold an impediment to travel, compared it to an ocean reef. Furthermore, the park's rounded sandstone hills were likened to the dome of the U. S. capitol in Washington, D. C. Most visitors to Capitol Reef explore only a cross section in the north of the park along the Fremont River Valley and an 11-mile-long (18-km-long) scenic drive south from the visitor center. <BR><BR>Portions of Canyonlands National Park, now 527 square miles (1,365 square km) in size, were first set aside in 1964. The Colorado River and Green River, whose confluence lies deep within the park, divide Canyonlands into three districts while providing ample opportunities for river running. ""Islands in the Sky,"" the most popular district of the park, is a mesa which offers spectacular views over 1,300-foot-high (396-meter-high) cliffs. The less-visited ""Needles"" district in the southeastern part of the park has paved road access and provides views of canyons, arches and various rock formations. On the other hand, the difficult-to-reach wild country of ""The Maze"" in the southwestern part of the park is seldom visited by tourists. <BR><BR>A visit to Utah's five national parks provides ample learning opportunities. First and foremost, visitors will be exposed to the unique geology of the region. They will also obtain an introduction to the native flora and fauna. In addition to seeing various types of trees and plants, they are likely to encounter mule deer, chipmunks, and other mammals and many species of birds. The ruins, relics and graffiti left behind both by ancient inhabitants and by more recent Mormon settlers are also evident in many locations in these national parks and throughout southern Utah. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",145
7,23,"""Zambia: A New Safari Destination,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in August 2005 </P><P >Landlocked Zambia , situated in southeastern Africa north of Zimbabwe , takes its name from the <st1:PlaceName>Zambezi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType> . The Zambezi begins in northeastern Zambia and flows 1,550 miles to the Indian Ocean , forming Zambia's southern border. There, lying astride Zambia and Zimbabwe , lies Victoria Falls , one of Africa's most beautiful and best-known sights. <BR><BR> Zambia was inhabited in prehistoric times. Bantu tribes invaded from the sixteenth century onward. They were followed by Arab slave traders, the Portuguese and other African tribes in the nineteenth century. David Livingstone discovered the Victoria Falls in 1855. Britain took formal control in 1924 and ruled what was then called Northern Rhodesia until independence in 1964. <BR><BR>As large as France , much of Zambia is a plateau lying at an altitude of 3,000 to 7,000 feet. Zambia's economy is based on copper and cobalt mining. Its capital, Lusaka , was a mere railway station as late as 1905. Today, although it boasts a population of over 1.5 million and has a pleasant climate year-round, Lusaka offers little to international safari enthusiasts who typically use it only as a jumping-off point. Instead, much smaller Livingstone, near Victoria Falls , is considered Zambia's major tourist town. <BR><BR> Zambia has set aside one-third of its territory for the preservation of wildlife through the creation of 19 national parks. A safari in Zambia is different from a safari in East Africa because game walks and night game drives are both permitted in Zambia . Also, the safari vehicle in Zambia is usually open-air rather than a closed van with a pop-up roof as in East Africa . Zambia's four primary tourist attractions are the <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Valley</st1:PlaceType> , <st1:PlaceName>Kafue</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> , <st1:PlaceName>Lower</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Zambezi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> and Victoria Falls . <BR><BR>The superb <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Valley</st1:PlaceType> , which stretches across the entire length of eastern Zambia , is noted for its rocky escarpments and for the wide, muddy <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType> . The combined North and <st1:PlaceName>South</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Parks</st1:PlaceType> constitute a vast sanctuary of 3,500 square miles where game is truly abundant. Thornicroft's giraffe is indigenous to South Luangwa , and small herds of Cookson's wildebeest are unique to this park. There is a large concentration of elephant, and black rhino is found in large numbers. In addition to 50 other species of mammals, leopard, lion, hyena and hippo are common; and over 400 bird species have been recorded. <st1:PlaceName>North</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> is managed as a wilderness area. Yet even in <st1:PlaceName>South</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> the effects of mass tourism have not been seen. With its small camps and lodges, South Luangwa is one of Africa's premier wildlife destinations. <BR><BR>At roughly half the size of Switzerland , <st1:PlaceName>Kafue</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> is one of Africa's largest game reserves. Only a two-hour drive from Lusaka , Kafue is both diverse and well-endowed with game and birds. In fact, Kafue boasts more species of antelope than any other African game park. However, the animals are more difficult to view in Kafue since they are not as habituated to humans as are those animals in South Luangwa . <BR><BR> <st1:PlaceName>Lower</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Zambezi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> extends for 75 miles along the <st1:PlaceName>Zambezi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType> opposite Zimbabwe's <st1:PlaceName>Mana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Pools</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> . With permanent water, there is an abundance of elephant, buffalo and antelope. This in turn attracts lion, leopard and hyena. The Zambezi contains a multitude of fish. Tigerfish are especially popular with anglers. Also, bird life is prolific. <BR><BR>A visit to Victoria Falls can be combined with a safari in Zambia very easily. One of the seven natural wonders of the world, Victoria Falls really must be seen to be believed. The Zambezi is more than 1,700 yards wide at the falls, where the water drops 100 yards or more into a narrow chasm. The resulting spray is so great that, when the moon shines, a lunar rainbow is created! Also, the area around Victoria Falls has grown into southern Africa's adventure tourism capital. The activities on offer include white water rafting, canoeing, riverboarding, jet boats, boat cruises, bungee jumping, helicopter flights, microlighting, absailing, horse safaris and even elephant rides! <BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES AND SUGGESTIONS:<BR></B><BR>The best time to visit the excellent <st1:PlaceName>South</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Luangwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>National Park</st1:PlaceType> is during the dry season, from June to October. Then the game is concentrated around the remaining water holes. Also, the grasses are shorter during the dry season, which makes wildlife viewing easier. <BR><BR>The best time to visit Victoria Falls is also from June to October. Then the water volume is not at its maximum so there is less mist to obscure the views. During morning and late afternoon the light is best for photography, and don't forget your polarizing filter to capture the rainbows! <BR><BR>Currently the least expensive total round trip airfare on Kenya Airways from Cairo to Lusaka via Nairobi is approximately USD 763. For this fare the minimum stay is six nights and the maximum stay is 30 nights.<BR><BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO ZAMBIA:</P><P>Lusaka International Airport is Zambia's largest. Some safari enthusiasts and those only visiting the Victoria Falls area will prefer Livingstone International Airport, which receives regional flights from South Africa and elsewhere.<BR><BR></P>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",418
8,23,"<BR>""Exotic Vietnam,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2006<BR> <BR></SPAN><P >Exotic Vietnam with its beautiful topography, unique sights, friendly people and excellent shopping, makes for a very interesting tourist destination. As large as the U. S. states of Virginia , North Carolina and South Carolina combined, Vietnam offers many different types of terrain. There are mountains, dense jungles, coastal plains and also river delta. One of the thinnest countries in the world, Vietnam is 2,600 km long; but the width varies between only 60 km and 200 km, except in the far north where it is much wider. <BR><BR>Most tourists will be interested in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Saigon) in the South, Hanoi in the North, and the central region containing the seaport of Danang, the historical capital of Hue and the charming town of Hoi An. In addition, the Central Highlands may be of interest to those with additional time; and beautiful Halong Bay in the North will be viewed by those arriving in Vietnam via ship.<BR><BR>Vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam and one of the most thriving cities in Southeast Asia, was built on a bend in the Saigon River. With a population of nearly seven million, 300-year-old Ho Chi Minh City is the nation's economic heart. <BR><BR>At one time on a par with Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City has been called the Paris of the East. Today it boasts colorful markets where everything from French baguettes to lacquer boxes is sold. Waves of motorbikes flow past the city's French-built architectural landmarks such as the neo-Classical Notre Dame Cathedral, completed in 1880, and the French-era municipal theatre and city hall. <BR><BR>Fortunately, the sights of central Saigon can be reached on foot in less than half an hour from any of the hotels in the city center. The tourist circuit usually includes Reunification Hall (formerly the presidential palace before the 1975 fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese), the Rex Hotel (frequented by American soldiers prior to ""liberation""), the historical museum, the central market, Cholon (Chinatown), the war remnants museum (housed in the building formerly occupied by the U. S. Information Service), and one or more of the city's 200 pagodas. <BR><BR>At Cu Chi, 70 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, there is a network of more than 200 km of man-made tunnels which once allowed the Viet Cong to wage war on Saigon. This is a popular half-day excursion. These fascinating passages, enlarged in places after the Vietnam War to accommodate the larger bodies of foreign tourists, contained underground hospitals, kitchens, sleeping and living quarters and arms storage centers. <BR><BR>Hanoi, the charming and laid-back capital city with its tree-lined boulevards, elegant squares, old colonial-era buildings, lakes, and parks, was built on the Red River about 100 km inland from the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea. Tourist highlights include the Temple of Literature (founded in 1070 and dedicated to Confucious), the old, so-called French Quarter in central Hanoi with its maze of narrow alleys, Hoa Lo Prison (also known as the ""Hanoi Hilton"" which once housed U. S. prisoners of war, including U. S. Senator John McCain), Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and museum (including his modest house and the former presidential palace in which he refused to live), and national museums for history and the arts. <BR><BR>Danang, Hue and Hoi An are clustered in the central region of Vietnam. It is logical to break one's air journey at Danang when flying between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. <BR><BR>Danang, a major seaport and Vietnam's fourth largest city, is known for Marble Mountain, China Beach and the Cham Museum. Marble Mountain is the collective name by which five nearby limestone crags with marble outcrops are known. China Beach, 1 km from Marble Mountain and but one of Vietnam's many fine white sandy beaches, was a popular American R & R destination during the Vietnam War. The Cham Museum, constructed in Danang by the French in 1916, contains art and architecture from the Cham Dynasty of the second century A. D. <BR><BR>Hue, Vietnam's capital between 1802 and 1945, is located on the Perfume River some 108 km north of Danang and 100 km south of the Seventeenth Parallel which once separated North Vietnam from South Vietnam. Although invaded by the French and the Japanese and then later bombed by the U. S. in 1968, many tombs and other historical monuments still remain in and around the former Imperial City. <BR><BR>Historic Hoi An, 32 km south of Danang, has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Vietnam. This small and intimate town can be explored easily on foot. Originally settled by Chinese and Japanese merchants in the sixteenth century, Portuguese and Dutch ships also called there. However, by the end of the nineteenth century Danang finally eclipsed Hoi An in importance as the river which runs through Hoi An began to silt up. The Japanese covered bridge, dating to the sixteenth century, is Hoi An's most-photographed monument.<BR><BR>For those with additional time, the Central Highlands will also beckon. This lush area offers some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in Vietnam. The French used this region as a hill station due to its favorable climate with warm days and cool nights. Interestingly, this region is home to as many as 35 of only 50 or so ethnic groups that exist in all of Vietnam .<BR><BR>Finally, those lucky enough to visit Vietnam via ship (and those willing to undertake a long day trip from Hanoi) are likely to encounter the scenic turquoise waters of Halong Bay near the port of Haiphong in the North. Over 3,000 limestone islets dot the bay. Some islets have miniscule beaches and some have spectacular caves and grottoes. Most islets are covered with lush vegetation. It has been said that Halong Bay, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, is the most beautiful location in all of Vietnam .<BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES: </B> <BR><BR>In Cairo the Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam will only issue 14-day single-entry tourist visas. Tourists requiring a longer period of stay must request an extension after arrival in Vietnam. <BR><BR>Another important concern is that Vietnam tourist visas are issued in Cairo strictly no more than 15 days prior to entry into Vietnam . Because of this restriction, travelers planning multi-country itineraries may be forced to spend time in Vietnam prior to touring other countries in Southeast Asia. In fact, travelers should give consideration to combining a visit to Thailand and/or Angkor Wat in Cambodia with their trip to Vietnam. Air routings to Vietnam typically include Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.<BR><BR>The best time to visit Ho Chi Minh City is between December and April. This is the dry season, although there is still occasional rain even then. April is the hottest and most humid month. The wet season runs from May to November, with the wettest period lasting from June to September.<BR><BR>The best time to visit Hanoi is during the dry season between late September and December or else in March and April. January and February are cool and drizzly. May to September is the rainy season when the heat can be oppressive.<BR><BR>The best time to visit the Central Highlands is from December to February, and the very best time to visit Danang and Hue on the coast is in April. Danang and Hue are deluged by the southwest monsoon in October while the northeast monsoon affects the central coast from December to February. <BR><BR> <BR>Ted Cookson </P><P >Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt </P><P >8 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A><BR><BR></P>",562
9,23,"""A Travelers' Century Club-Inspired 'Fly Through' of Somalia,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in September 2003 </P><P >Dust off your atlas!<BR><BR>I returned to Cairo on the morning of 8 April 2003 after a 4-day/5-night trip to Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti. The entire trip was centered around a Somalia ""fly through"" from Nairobi to Djibouti on 5 April. The ""fly through"" finally allowed me to complete my Travelers' Century Club (TCC) collection of 52 destinations in Africa. Organized in Los Angeles in 1954 by a group of the world’s most widely-traveled people, the TCC maintains a list of 317 countries and places.<BR><BR>Actually, I had visited Somalia previously. I had flown to Hargeisa in northern Somalia (and also to Djibouti and North Yemen) in January 1985. While working in Riyadh I had managed to obtain a Somalia tourist visa. But to do so I had had to phone the Somali consul in Jeddah and chat him up on a number of occasions over a period of several months. Finally, when I learned that the consul planned to visit Riyadh on business, I sent some toys for his kids to his hotel. With that gift I finally struck gold. The consul then relented and granted me a tourist visa to Somalia. <BR><BR>The reason for my April visit to Somalia was that in 1999 the TCC finally recognized that the northern Somali province had split away from Somalia to become the independent republic of Somaliland. (The North, calling itself Somaliland since the early 1990’s, is the former British Somaliland, the capital of which is Hargeisa. Unfortunately for Somaliland it is not yet recognized officially by any other country!) That meant that I had to undertake a trip to Mogadishu or to one of the other cities in the South in order to be able to include Somalia in my TCC destination count again. My earlier visit to Hargeisa counted only for Somaliland after the breakaway. <BR><BR>So on the night of 3 April I flew from Cairo to Nairobi via Khartoum on Kenya Airways. I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Nairobi’s premier Indian restaurant on 4 April. Then early on Saturday morning I checked in at Unit One of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for my 8-hour Daallo Airlines flight from Nairobi to Djibouti via Mogadishu and Galckayo (pronounced “Gal-keye’-oh”) in Somalia and Hargeisa in Somaliland. <BR><BR>For many Westerners the names ""Mogadishu"" and ""Somalia"" conjure up visions of the extremely bloody movie ""Black Hawk Down."" I had seen the first half of that movie myself last year but had had to walk out before it was over after the constant gore finally became unbearable. <BR><BR>In fact, I had written off the possibility of visiting Somalia during the past few years for the obvious security reasons. But then I learned about the existence of Daallo Airlines (<A href=""http://www.daallo.com/"" eudora=""autourl"">www.daallo.com</A>), which serves Somalia using Djibouti as a hub, from several fellow TCC members. One flew Daallo to Mogadishu disguised in Arab garb. Another fearlessly flew to Mogadishu with his wife and child! And two others flew to Mogadishu with only a minor hitch. They were taken aside and isolated from the other passengers on their aircraft after the crew realized that, as loudly-conversing Westerners, they were beginning to receive threatening glances from some of the Somalis on board. <BR><BR>I realized that if these people had all been able to fly into Somalia and live to tell me about it later, then I should be able to get in and out safely too. Also, I thought the time was especially ripe now since Somalia peace talks have been ongoing in Kenya since late last year.<BR><BR>Still, there was always some doubt about safety in my mind. So it was with some relief that I found that I was not the only Caucasian checking in at Nairobi. As it turned out, four other Westerners were on my flight, including one other American! Two of the four - a Spaniard and an Aussie - were AID workers, and the American was probably either an AID worker or an architect since he was carrying blueprints. I never spoke with the fourth who, judging from his accent, was probably from eastern Europe.<BR><BR>The Daallo aircraft was an aging Ilyushin-18 four-engine turboprop which had apparently done time in Thailand, judging from the script used for the on board signs. The plane was manned by a six-person Russian crew - a pilot, a navigator, two mechanics, a fellow whom I think was a security guard since I never saw him do anything other than stand around, and a stewardess who spoke limited but functional English (""soft drink - take!""). <BR><BR>With about 80 seats, the aircraft featured - in typical Russian style - a curtained ""V. I. P."" section in the rear with a dozen seats and, I think, the only passenger toilet on board. The large toilet compartment, which reeked of the blue liquid chemicals flowing in the seatless toilet bowl, served a dual purpose. First and foremost, it was indeed a toilet. But it was also used to store crates of soft drinks manufactured in Jeddah.<BR><BR>Acting protectively, one of the two Somali stewards managed to steer three of the Westerners, including me, into the back VIP compartment as we boarded. Two of the other Westerners sat up front with the other Somalis. <BR><BR>It was a 2-hour flight from mile-high Nairobi northeast to Mogadishu's sea level ""Km 50 Airport,"" situated 50 km, or 30 miles, from town. Sandwiches from Nairobi and soda pop were served for breakfast. I was probably the only passenger who realized that the soda pop had come from our toilet. Not long before we arrived at Mogadishu it was easy to spot the meandering Juba River, the main river in southern Somalia, through the aircraft's large round windows. <BR><BR>The landing after noon on the smooth dirt strip at Km 50 Airport was an exciting one. Our experienced Russian pilot brought the plane in for a perfect three-point landing. The four props stirred up lots of dust, obscuring the sage brush which covered the flat terrain outside. We taxied over to a large cement slab on the far side of the strip opposite some small nondescript single-story structures. At any other world airport these structures would have been called a terminal building. But here there was nothing so formal as that.<BR><BR>After the engines had been turned off, our on board Russian maintenance team climbed right down the stairs and began to change one of our ten extremely worn aircraft tires. Luckily, all spares were carried with us. <BR> <BR>I saw no guns at all in Somalia. There was no obvious armed security. One man dressed in military fatigues did shoo away two kids who wandered up to the aircraft stairs at one point. But he did nothing to control the crowd of perhaps 50 Somalis who gathered in the shade of the aircraft's belly and under the wide wings. These were disembarking passengers as well as both greeters and stragglers who had wandered over from the direction of the low buildings across the airstrip. <BR><BR>Baggage from Nairobi was offloaded by hand down a simple ladder and onto a pickup truck, and boarding passengers' baggage was similarly hoisted up by hand into the baggage compartment. <BR><BR>I asked a Somali bystander if he could sell me some local currency, and he directed me to a young man in a pickup who flashed a thick wad of Somali 1,000-shilling notes. As a souvenir, I purchased 1,700 Somali shillings for one U. S. dollar. <BR><BR>After smelling gasoline blowing in the warm wind under the plane, I glanced up and noticed that jet fuel was leaking in steady drips onto the ground from the fuel tank in our right wing. Since the maintenance crew was paying no attention to the dripping, I figured that it was just par for the course. At least no one was smoking close to the plane.<BR><BR>The blueprint-toting American on board actually disembarked at Mogadishu. He had been accompanied from Nairobi by a well-dressed Somali man. During the flight I had overheard the Somali instruct the American to proceed directly to the car that would be awaiting them upon arrival. The Somali said that he would handle the formalities for both of them.<BR><BR>After nearly an hour on the ground at Mogadishu we lumbered up into the warm skies again, this time more full, with 67 passengers on board. Lunch, served with plastic silverware, was pasta smothered in Unknown Sauce (was that meat in the sauce or not?). I think lunch may also have been catered in Nairobi. But the pasta made me think of Somalia's Italian colonial heritage, and I wondered how much that heritage must have influenced the national diet. After an hour and a half of flying over parched, wadi-pocked terrain, we landed on the paved airstrip near Galckayo, located on the edge of the Ogaden Desert just south of the joint in Somalia's great geographical dog leg. <BR><BR>I also disembarked at Galckayo. While I was staring at the bald aircraft tires, one of the Russian maintenance men walked by, smiled and apologized, in his thickly-accented and broken English, ""Crazy country, Somalia - NOT Russia!,"" as if to acknowledge that the tires of this aircraft would not have been quite so bald had it been operating back home. Fortunately there was no further changing of tires at Galckayo as it was by then mid-afternoon and quite warm out. Since the dripping fuel was no longer a novelty, I didn't linger long in the hot shade of the aircraft but elected to return to my smelly seat near the V. I. P. compartment toilet. There was a breeze blowing in the airplane's doorway, at least. <BR><BR>I didn't overhear the passenger count for the next leg. But many passengers did disembark at Galckayo. It was another hour of flying northwest to Hargeisa in the former British Somaliland. The small terminal at Hargeisa with its stubby control tower proclaiming the altitude in feet is another remnant of the colonial era. In Hargeisa I asked the Daallo ground handler for help in buying some local currency. He directed me to an old man who led me through a crowd to a bank window in the side of the terminal building. I purchased 3,500 Somaliland shillings for one U. S. dollar before reboarding the plane. And these bills were crisp and new as opposed to the fingered Somalia bills I'd gotten at Mogadishu.<BR><BR>For the final half hour flight there were only two passengers. No passengers boarded in Hargeisa for the last short hop over to Djibouti on the coast. Landing at Djibouti at 5:30 p.m., an airport bus carried the two of us over to the terminal. I cleared immigration and took a taxi to the Djibouti Sheraton four miles away. The driver, with whom I conversed in Arabic, pointed out the French military barracks as well as a small American military presence. <BR><BR>Due to thin air schedules I had spent four nights in Djibouti in 1985, so I didn't feel a pressing need to play tourist there again this time. Djibouti is a poor, sanitized French-speaking Arabia wannabe which can exist primarily because of French foreign aid. Instead I soaked up the local color on the Preferred Floor of the Djibouti Sheraton for two days, finishing Paul Theroux's latest African travel tale, Dark Star Safari, and keeping up with events in Iraq on the 18 satellite channels piped into the room. This hotel property had really been upgraded since I last stayed there in 1985. What I couldn't figure out was why many of the rooms on my floor were occupied by German-speaking soldiers. Perhaps there were military training exercises in the Djibouti desert.<BR><BR>On Monday night I flew back to Cairo on the Ethiopian Airlines red eye service via Addis Ababa and Khartoum. The brand new air terminal in Addis is marvelous compared to the run-down old terminal which is now scheduled to be converted for use with domestic flights. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, I had been required to obtain a visa for Djibouti in Cairo prior to departure. But, had I wished to remain in Somalia, no visa would have been required since Somalia is not a functioning country. It's still just a collection of warlords. <BR><BR><BR></P><P>HOW TO GET TO SOMALIA:<BR><BR>Daallo Airlines (<A href=""http://www.daallo.com/"">www.daallo.com</A>) is the primary airline serving Somalia.</P>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>21 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",408

In fact, most visitors proceed directly to their resort accommodations east or west of Faro by rental car, completely bypassing the city of Faro, which is the most populated town in the Algarve and its capital.<BR><BR>Many holiday villages are clustered around quaint Albufeira, which is situated near excellent beaches northwest of Faro. Albufeira is one of the Algarve's largest and most popular resort destinations. <BR><BR>An excellent day trip through the western part of the Algarve can be made by car using Albufeira as a base. The circuit includes the Moorish capital of Silves, the historic Sagres where Prince Henry the Navigator once dwelled, nearby Cape Vincent, and the small port of Lagos founded by the Phoenicians.<BR><BR>Silves, situated in the hills 18 km (11 miles) northeast of the port of Portimao, was the grand home of the Moorish kings who ruled the province of Al-Gharb which, incidentally, means ""the West"" in Arabic. Silves' picturesque medieval Moorish castle is the largest in the Algarve. Today a gigantic Crusader statue standing just outside the castle serves to remind that this fortress was sacked by Crusaders in 1189. Wonderful views of the surrounding countryside can be had from the walls of the castle, which still dominates Silves today. The town also boasts a Gothic cathedral built on the site of an old mosque. The streets of Silves are still laid out just as they were in the medieval medina. <BR><BR>It was at Sagres in the fifteenth century that Prince Henry the Navigator established his navigation school at which Magellan, Cabral and da Gama all studied. Today Prince Henry's fortaleza is the principal tourist site at Sagres. A fifteenth-century stone wind compass 43 meters (140 feet) in diameter dominates the entrance to the fortress, and there are spectacular sea views over the tall cliffs from the long walkway along the ancient walls. Interestingly, within the fortress, the altar of the sixteenth-century Church of Our Lady of Grace depicts Saint Vincent holding a ship.<BR><BR>Cape Vincent, Portugal's westernmost promontory, has been inhabited since the Neolithic era. In Classical times the cape was thought to be sacred. After the remains of Saint Vincent were brought there following the Arab invasion, Cape Vincent drew pilgrims for centuries. Today this spectacular but windy western promontory sports only a lighthouse, a tiny tourist market, and few fishermen trying their luck. <BR><BR>En route back to Albufeira is the fishing town of Lagos whose natural harbor attracted the Phoenicians. Later the Moors settled in Lagos until the town was retaken by Christian forces in 1241. Prince Henry used Lagos as a base for his African trade. In fact, Europe's first slave market was in Lagos. Today the town is known mainly for its nearby cliffs, coves and beautiful beaches and for the convenient motorway which now connects it with Lisbon, Faro and even with Spain. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN ><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 February 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com </FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com </FONT></A></SPAN></SPAN></P>",305
12,23,"HOW TO GET TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:</P><P><!--StartFragment -->Normally about half a dozen cruise ships call at Pitcairn annually. However, only occasionally do any of these cruise ships ever land passengers on the island. When this does happen, it is almost always one of the islanders' longboats which is used to transport people ashore. Yacht charters to Pitcairn are possible from Mangareva in French Polynesia. These charters can be arranged via an agent in the U. S. Finally, supply vessels visit Pitcairn on an irregular basis, either from Mangareva or once in awhile from New Zealand. It might be possible to purchase passage on one of these sailings.</P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:<BR><BR>""A Visit to Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2003 </P><P>On 25 January 2003 I sailed from Valparaiso, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on the 513-passenger German-registered cruise ship MS Deutschland. During the 16-day cruise the Deutschland called at Chile's Robinson Crusoe Island, Easter Island and Pitcairn Island as well as Fakarava and Moorea in French Polynesia. On 4 February I landed at Pitcairn in smooth seas and got to explore that island for half a day. <BR><BR>I had first attempted to land at Pitcairn during a previous cruise on the Deutschland in August 2000. However, that attempt was frustrated by a 3-meter sea swell. No passengers were allowed to disembark from the Deutschland that time. Then in November 2002 during a second Pitcairn attempt aboard the Seven Seas Navigator I did manage to land. But because passengers were recalled to the ship after only 20 minutes, I never had a chance to explore anything but Pitcairn's dock area. <BR><BR>I have been fascinated by faraway Pitcairn Island for nearly 40 years. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read Nordhoff and Hall's Bounty Trilogy novels (Mutiny on the Bounty, Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island) and began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. <BR><BR>One of the most remote of the world's inhabited islands, Pitcairn lies in the South Pacific Ocean roughly midway between Tahiti and Easter Island. Pitcairn Island is 4,155 nautical miles (nm) southwest of Los Angeles, 3,504 nm northwest of Santiago, Chile and 3,314 nm northeast of Wellington, New Zealand. Pitcairn is 11,281 nm from Cairo.<BR><BR>Pitcairn was discovered in 1767 by a midshipman named Pitcairn aboard HMS Swallow, but the island was not settled until 1790 when Fletcher Christian and his band of mutineers arrived aboard the Bounty. In a tale immortalized on film by Clark Gable and Charles Laughton (1934), Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard (1962) and Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (1984), Fletcher Christian seized the Bounty from Captain William Bligh and eventually steered it to Pitcairn Island.<BR><BR>The Bounty had sailed from England in 1787 on a mission to gather breadfruit trees in Polynesia and transport them to the British West Indies where, it was thought, breadfruit would provide a new, cheap source of food for slaves on the sugar plantations. After ten months and 27,000 nm of sailing, the Bounty finally arrived in Tahiti. During the five months which the ship remained in Tahiti while young breadfruit trees were cultivated, many of the crew became captivated by the local women. <BR><BR>The famous mutiny on the Bounty took place some 3 1/2 weeks into the sail from Tahiti westward toward the West Indies. Bligh and 18 loyal crew were set adrift in a longboat. Against all odds nearly all of these men eventually reached Dutch-held Timor (Indonesia) after a 3,600-nm open boat voyage. Meanwhile, Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers returned to Tahiti for their women. After leaving behind at Tahiti 16 men who wished to remain, nine mutineers and their women plus nine other Polynesian men and women roamed the Pacific for several months in search of an island on which they could hide. Eventually Fletcher Christian sailed the Bounty to Pitcairn which, fortunately, had been charted incorrectly by 200 miles. There the Bounty was burned to hide all evidence of the mutineers' arrival.<BR><BR>Most of the 50 current inhabitants of Pitcairn are descendants of the original Bounty mutineers and the Polynesians who accompanied them. Some of the others are descendants of shipwrecked sailors who decided to remain on the island and marry.<BR><BR>The Pitcairn Islands, which consist of Pitcairn plus the uninhabited Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, are today administered as a British colony via an administrative headquarters in New Zealand. Pitcairn's island council handles such local affairs as island maintenance, postal and medical services and communications. Pitcairn's chief source of income derives from the sale of postage stamps to collectors. <BR><BR>About one mile wide and two miles long, Pitcairn is of volcanic origin. The highest point on the island is some 1,100 feet. The land is hilly but fertile; and the islanders grow sweet potatoes, yams, pineapples, cabbages, beans, tomatoes, citrus and bananas. There are no farm animals, although poultry and wild goats exist on the island. <BR><BR>Pitcairn is completely surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs. There is only one small harbor, at Bounty Bay. Access to this harbor is via longboat operated by the islanders. A longboat carries about two dozen passengers on an open deck. Even in calm seas getting into and out of a Pitcairn longboat while it is alongside a cruise ship can be challenging. The longboat bobs up and down with the waves, so the timing of one's step is everything. On my previous landing at Pitcairn I had to climb down a rope ladder and then jump ""blind"" into a longboat when instructed to do so by the crew. Luckily this time the Deutschland employed an external stairway. But even the slight sea swell still made the step into the longboat an exciting one. <BR><BR>Upon landing on the island, I first had my photograph taken in front of the ""Welcome to Pitcairn Island"" sign above the boathouse. The next order of business was climbing the so-called Hill of Difficulty to reach the small settlement of Adamstown, named for the last surviving mutineer. One of the Bounty anchors is displayed in the small town square. Facing the square are the post office, the courthouse, the museum, the library and a Seventh Day Adventist church. In the church is one of the original Bounty bibles. <BR><BR>I was fortunate to be offered a tour of the entire island in an open all-terrain vehicle. The first stop was on a hilltop called Ship Landing Point overlooking Bounty Bay from where I could view Adamstown. Above the settlement is a large cave where Fletcher Christian maintained a watch out over the sea. <BR><BR>Then we drove to St. Paul's Point. Directly below, islanders can enjoy an ocean swim in a pool which is afforded protection by large boulders. On the way we passed a very steep trail leading to ""Down Rope."" There on the cliff face are inscribed Polynesian petroglyphs. From these markings and a few stone tools found on the island it is known that Polynesians visited Pitcairn long before the arrival of the Bounty mutineers. <BR><BR>My tour continued to Tautama where I saw wild goats grazing. Then we drove to Taro Ground where the radio station is situated. Ham radio enthusiasts from around the world are ever eager to make contact with remote Pitcairn. We went on to the highest point on the island, and from there we drove down Garnet's Ridge back to Adamstown. On the way I took in views of beautiful uninhabited ""Tedside."" This term is apparently a corruption of the phrase ""the other side.""<BR><BR>Back in Adamstown, I visited the schoolhouse. A school teacher from New Zealand is posted to the island on a two-year contract. I also saw the unoccupied and delapidated house of Thursday October Christian, Fletcher Christian's first son, who died in 1866. Nearby is the cemetery which contains gravestones dating back to the nineteenth century. <BR><BR>On the way back to the longboat I stopped at The Edge which overlooks Bounty Bay. There rests the anchor of the Acadia, one of the many ships which has foundered in the Pitcairn Islands over the years. The Acadia ran aground at Ducie Island in 1881. The anchor was raised and carried to Pitcairn in 1990.<BR><BR>While I had been exploring Pitcairn during the morning, about 35 islanders had come aboard the Deutschland to sell their wooden handicrafts, woven baskets, T-shirts and postage stamps. So after a quick lunch I shopped for wooden turtles, my favorite Pitcairn handicraft. I also purchased a large model of a Pitcairn longboat.<BR><BR>During afternoon tea three of the islanders were interviewed in the ship's auditorium. Then it was time for the Pitcairners to bid us goodbye. As they sailed away in their longboat, the islanders looked up at the ship's passengers crowded along the railings and sang us a farewell song. <BR> <BR>For further information about the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and about Pitcairn Island, visit <A href=""http://www.lareau.org/"" eudora=""autourl"">www.lareau.org</A>, which contains many useful links.

Those fascinated by the Pitcairn story will also be interested in Norfolk Island, situated between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia.  Because Pitcairn's inhabitants were evacuated to Norfolk (but some later returned to Pitcairn), the islands' histories are intertwined. .<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",57
13,23,"""A Flight Over Peru's Nazca Lines,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in October 2007 </P><P><SPAN >On 25 March 2007 when my cruise ship, the 2,600-passenger <I>Golden Princess</I>, docked in San Martin, south of Lima, Peru , I paid USD 309 to take a seven-hour group shore excursion which included a flight over southern Peru's mysterious Nazca Lines. <BR><BR>The Nazca Lines, credited to the Nazca Culture which thrived in southern Peru between 200 B. C. and 700 A. D., consist of geoglyphs (trapezoids, circles, spirals, triangles and straight lines) and biomorphs (images of people, animals, birds, fish, lizards, insects and perhaps even flowers). These geoglyphs and biomorphs are distributed over an area of some 200 square miles (500 square km) on the high, dry Nazca Plateau. This region of Peru is one of the world's most arid; and, in fact, both the lack of rainfall and the lack of wind in the area have helped to preserve the figures. <BR><BR>The Nazca figures were created by excavating iron oxide-covered gravel from the plain. The exposed, lighter-colored soil underneath contrasts with the darker color on the surface. Because the giant figures are unrecognizable to anyone standing on the surface of the earth, naturally speculation has arisen as to the abilities and intentions of those who created them. While it has been proven that a primitive culture could have created the Nazca Lines easily using simple tools and surveying techniques, the question as to why they were created remains a mystery. <BR><BR>Many varied theories have been proposed, including the following: (1) that Nazca was a giant astronomical calendar; (2) that Nazca was related to the flow of water from the nearby mountains to and through the plain; (3) that the Nazca figures were the tracks for races among men; (4) that the Nazca figures represent the patterns and yarns of the weaving done by the local culture; (5) that Nazca represents a map of the Tiahuanaco Empire; (6) that Nazca is a response to an unusual period when there were multiple solar eclipses; and, perhaps most famously, (7) that Nazca was the work of aliens or, at least, that the inhabitants of Nazca used hot air balloons to view these figures from the air. <BR><BR>Our chartered single-engine Aero Condor Grand Caravan propeller-driven aircraft flew south 85 miles (137 km) to the Nazca Lines from the commercial airport at Ica, Peru. Ica, which was in the headlines worldwide after suffering a severe earthquake in mid-August 2007, is situated some 50 miles (80 km) from the port of San Martin. Although the total round trip flight required about 80 minutes, most of that time was necessary in order to travel back and forth from Ica. <BR><BR>Over Nazca itself I found it very difficult to take either still photos or video clips due to the pilot's continuous extreme aerial maneuvering and my lack of familiarity with the placement of the images on the plain itself. Also, unusually, my stomach became a bit upset due to the pilot's excessive banking. Luckily, however, I did not actually have to make use of the flight sickness bags which were available on the plane. <BR><BR>While I am glad I took the tour, I now wish that I had concentrated simply on viewing the Nazca Lines rather than on trying to photograph them from the continuously-banking aircraft. My group tour also included a visit to the regional archeological museum at Ica, which features artifacts and mummies from the Paracas, Nazca and Ica cultures. <BR><BR>Online at <A style=""COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single"" href=""http://www.eptours.com/T0710-nazca.htm"">www.eptours.com/T0710-nazca.htm</A> readers will find links to three video clips which depict some of the dozen or so images I spotted from the plane. In addition to some 900 geoglyphs, the Nazca Plain is said to contain about 70 biomorphs. Not only is one of the figures 1,000 feet (300 meters) long, but one of the straight lines is 9 miles (14.5 km) long!

14,23,"""Oregon, Land of Contrasts,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in March 2008 </SPAN></P><P >The northwestern U. S. state of Oregon is the nation's tenth-largest, with an area of 251,419 square km (97,073 square miles). Sandwiched between California, Idaho, Washington, and the Pacific Ocean, Oregon contains four main geographical regions. From west to east, those regions are: the Pacific coast and the adjacent Coast Range; the fertile Willamette Valley; the beautiful Cascade Range and the much drier high desert plateau of Eastern Oregon. <BR><BR>The 583-kilometer-long (362-mile-long) Oregon coast includes rain forest, sand dunes and high basalt cliffs. The principal feature of the south coast is its evergreen forests. The largest stretch of oceanfront dunes in the U. S. lies along the south coast between Coos Bay and Florence. In the far north, Astoria, Lewis and Clark's destination on the Pacific, could be considered to be the oldest U. S. town west of Missouri. Altitudes in the Coast Range typically vary between 610 meters (2,000 feet) and 914 meters (3,000 feet). Mary's Peak, 19 km (12 miles) southwest of Corvallis, is the highest peak of the Coast Range with an altitude of 1,249 (4,097 feet).<BR><BR>The width of the fertile Willamette Valley (""Wil-a'-met"" with the stress being on the middle syllable where the ""a"" is pronounced like the ""a"" in ""fat""), stretching 193 km (120 miles) from south of Portland to below Eugene, varies from 40 to 64 km (25 to 40 miles). Settlers from the East began to arrive in this valley of plenty via the 3,219-kilometer-long (2,000-mile-long) Oregon Trail in the mid-nineteenth century, and this part of Oregon has always been the state's population center. Both Salem, the capital and third-largest city, and Eugene, the second largest city, are located in the Willamette Valley. <BR><BR>Portland, with a population of some 537,000, is situated near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. Oregon's largest city by far and also its commercial center, the metropolis was named after Portland, Maine in 1844 by the winner of a coin toss. (The other pioneer wanted to name the city after Boston, Massachusetts.) Portland's location has always enabled it to serve as an outlet to the sea for the Willamette Valley's agricultural produce as well as timber from Oregon's extensive forests. Over two-thirds of Oregon's population lives in Portland or within 48 km (30 miles) of the city.<BR><BR>The 25-million-year-old Cascade Range runs from north to south some 161 to 241 km (100 to 150 miles) from the ocean. These mountains separate Oregon's wet western section from its dry eastern half. The western slopes of the Cascades can attract up to 381 cm (150 inches) of rain and snow annually whereas those living east of the Cascades enjoy a mere 12 inches of precipitation annually and about 200 days a year of sunshine. Mt. Hood, Oregon's highest peak at 3,424 meters (11,235 feet), is the world's second-most-climbed glacier-covered peak. Incidentally, Mt. Hood was named for the British admiral who presided over the Mutiny on the Bounty trials. Four of Oregon's other Cascade peaks exceed 3,048 meters (10,000 feet) in height. <BR><BR>Eastern Oregon, lying in the rain shadow created by the Cascades, can be scorching by day and yet cool at night. It is a land of lava beds, livestock and fossils. Although less than 13% of Oregon's population lives east of the Cascades, parts of eastern Oregon are growing by leaps and bounds. During the 1980s and 1990s the population of Bend doubled to 60,000. Known for its skiing and other outdoor activities, Bend is often cited as being one of the best small American cities in which to live. <BR><BR>Oregon also boasts some superlatives. For instance, Crater Lake in south central Oregon is North America's deepest lake. Hells Canyon, created by the Snake River along Oregon's northeastern border with Idaho and averaging 2,012 meters (6,600 feet) in depth, is the world's deepest river-carved gorge.</P><P >Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>20 February 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com </FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com </FONT></A></SPAN></SPAN></P>",131
15,23,"On 21 August 2008 I drove a rental car some 345 km round trip from Fort Nelson (which lies at mile 300 on the Alaska Highway) in northeastern British Columbia up the excellent Liard Highway to the border with the Northwest Territories. Below is a link to the 56-second video clip I took at the Sixtieth Parallel. As this video clip begins we are looking from the BC/NWT border along the paved highway back into BC. Then the camera swings counter-clockwise approx. 250 degrees. You will notice that at this point the highway turns from good blacktop pavement into a good gravel road. There is an official welcome sign into the NWT another 1/2 km along the highway. That white sign is just barely visible in the far distance in the video clip. I wanted to film at this point where the road surface changes. Incidentally, my car was rented from National Car Rental at the Shell station in ""downtown"" Fort Nelson. The cheapest rate was CAD 70 per day plus taxes and CAD 0.40 per km with no free kms! Round trip driving time from Fort Nelson was about four hours, including many stops for photos along the way. The Liard Highway is signposted for 80 km/hour but no one I saw was driving that slow. On the Liard Highway itself I passed only nine vehicles while heading north and eighteen vehicles when returning south.<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mOfw8pcev4"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mOfw8pcev4</a><br><br>.<BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",125
16,23,"HOW TO GET TO OGASAWARA:</P><P>The detailed information below, compiled by Ted Cookson in May 2002, was submitted twice to the Travelers Century Club but never published by that organizaiton as ""trip notes,"" presumably because of the inclusion of a travel agent's name and contact information. However, a point was made of including that data specifically since the only way to reach the Ogasawara Islands by public transportation is via ferry from Tokyo, Japan. Because the ferry operates on an irregular schedule and often sails fully-booked, it would be very difficult for those not familiar with the Japanese language to determine the schedule and to make firm round trip reservations by themselves. Thus a knowledgeable travel agent at home with a reliable correspondent agent in Japan is essential in planning a trip to this destination. Expect to pay a travel agent service fee as the ferry is not commissionable to your home travel agent. <BR><BR><BR>MY VISIT TO OGASAWARA: </P><P>On <st1:date Year=""2002"" Day=""27"" Month=""4"">27 April 2002</st1:date> upon arrival via United Airlines at Tokyo's <st1:PlaceName>Narita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType> terminal one I purchased a one way ticket for the Skyliner express train on the Keisei Line to Nippori Station in downtown Tokyo . The Skyliner, which offers only reserved seating, stopped at <st1:PlaceName>Narita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType> terminal two and at the nearby town of Narita en route to Nippori Station, where I disembarked. Travel time was 55 minutes. (The travel time for a similar limited express service is 70 minutes. But, interestingly, the fare for the limited express is only about half that of the Skyliner service (1,000 yen or about USD 8 versus 1,920 yen or about USD 15. I actually rode the limited express on my return trip and it was just fine. The seats were like on a <st1:State> New York </st1:State> subway car.) At <st1:PlaceName>Narita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType> I found the Japanese rail vending machines to be incomprehensible, so I bought my ticket at the window instead. The clerk who sold me a Skyliner ticket also sold me an onward one way rail ticket within Tokyo (160 yen) and gave me a useful Tokyo ""tourist map"" which showed the transit network. Incidentally, the exchange rate at <st1:PlaceName>Narita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType> was USD 1.00 = 125 yen on <st1:date Year=""2002"" Day=""27"" Month=""4"">27 April 2002</st1:date>. </P><P >At Nippori I disembarked from the Skyliner and changed from the Keisei Line, which was elevated there, to the elevated JR Yamanote Line, which I rode nine stops to reach Hamamatsucho Station. As a check, Tokyo Station is the sixth stop. It was an easy quarter of a mile walk (less than 10 minutes) to Tokyo's Takeshiba (Ferry) Passenger Terminal (TPT) from Hamamatsucho Station. There is an even closer elevated monorail stop called Takeshiba Station, but this is on a line which is not likely to be as convenient for someone coming from downtown Tokyo , and it requires two changes to reach this stop if coming from <st1:PlaceName>Narita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType> .</P><P > </P><P >Several high rise buildings are situated near TPT. These include Tokyo Bay Intercontinental Hotel. However, the (Bayside) Azur Takeshiba Hotel where I stayed (12,705 yen or approx. USD 102/night including taxes for a single without breakfast; my room was spotless but tiny and featured no English TV stations; the reception desk is on the fourth floor), is a better landmark because it bears the word ""Azur"" high on its side. This can be seen from quite a distance, though not immediately when one exits from Hamamatsucho Station. The Azur Takeshiba is adjacent to TPT, separated only by a small semi-circular plaza in the middle of which is an old wooden sailing ship's mast (there is no ship - just the mast).</P><P > </P><P >TPT is at ground level. But it is hidden under the elevated promenade along Takeshiba Pier. TPT is between the Azur Takeshiba Hotel and the Tokyo Bay Intercontinental Hotel. There is one office building between TPT and the Tokyo Bay Intercontinental Hotel.</P><P > </P><P >In order to receive my one way ferry ticket from Tokyo to Chichi-jima, I had to hand my exchange order (the Japanese language travel document which I was carrying and which resembled an air ticket printed on cardboard stock) to the clerk at window number 8 in Takeshiba Passenger Terminal. This was not allowed until less than two hours prior to departure.</P><P > </P><P >There is an information office at TPT, but not every person working in the office speaks English. Interestingly, one gentleman who spoke no English could write a few words of English - enough, in fact, so that I could figure out what time boarding would take place. (He wrote, ""On ship <st1:time Minute=""10"" Hour=""9"">9:10 a.m.</st1:time>"") Boarding commenced about 45 minutes prior to departure. The line formed out in the plaza. I unwittingly ""took cuts"" as boarding began by entering the line directly through the left-hand exit of the TPT rather than going out to the plaza first to get in line. No one seemed to notice or care, probably because I was one of about 10 non-Japanese passengers to board. Most of those other foreigners appeared to be boyfriends or girlfriends of Japanese passengers.</P><P > </P><P >Incidentally, there are plenty of vending machines in the TPT and also a change machine. There are well-marked toilets too. I didn't use it, but there is even an office where one can check baggage which is then be loaded onto the ferry and delivered back upon arrival at Chichi-jima.</P><P > </P><P >The ferry, Ogasawara Maru, 6,700 tons and holding several containers and hundreds of passengers (perhaps 500 passengers?? - this is just a guess), departed from Tokyo exactly on time at <st1:time Minute=""0"" Hour=""10"">10:00 a.m.</st1:time>; and it was comp0letely full on <st1:date Year=""2002"" Day=""28"" Month=""4"">28 April 2002</st1:date> due to the Japanese Golden Week holiday. I chose this departure date as the ferry would spend only 5 1/2 hours on the <st1:PlaceType>island</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName>Chichi-jima</st1:PlaceName> (part of the Ogasawara island group) before returning to Tokyo . However, I understand that the normal ferry schedule would require one to stay on Chichi-jima for some three or four nights rather than just half a day, while the ferry continued on to other islands, including the nearby Haha-jima. The ferry doesn't operate on the same schedule week after week. The schedules are announced far in advance but bookings are allowed only six months in advance.</P><P > </P><P >On board the ferry, vending machines offer Ramen noodles and many types of soda pop plus beer and water. There is a change machine. There is also a cold water fountain from which one can easily refill a mineral water bottle. There are a restaurant and a snack bar too, each of which has limited hours and serves Japanese food. The reception desk sells various junk foods plus postcards and other souvenirs. Finally, there is a small room with four video arcade-type game machines.</P><P > </P><P >While rather expensive cabin accommodation is available, I chose the much cheaper dormitory-style accommodation. Even this ran about USD 360 round trip. There were several second class dorms which accommodated about 100 passengers each and several others which held about 16 passengers. These were spread over the lower three decks. Place numbers are handed out in the order of boarding. But the first aboard do not necessary receive the ""best"" places. I was the first person in second class to board leaving Tokyo and I got a place next to a wall (which I thought was best) in a 16 passenger room. But I was also the first person in second class to board leaving Chichi-jima and I got a place exactly in the middle of a 100-passenger room. (Only one dorm room was utilized on the return as there weren't that many passengers.)</P><P > </P><P >Dormitory-style accommodation meant sleeping in an assigned place on the floor which had wall-to-wall carpeting. Etiquette requires one's shoes to be taken off before stepping on the carpeting. A blue woollen blanket was provided to sleep on and an orange woollen blanket was provided to pull over oneself. Sleeping on the floor was not really that uncomfortable as the blankets were quite thick.</P><P > </P><P >I had been worried about smoking. I guess there must have been a no smoking sign posted in Japanese because no one smoked in the dormitories.  However, everywhere else outside the dorms was fair game for smoking, and the smoke there was pretty thick. <br> <br>There were TVs with Japanese programming in the various dormitory rooms.  Movies were dubbed into Japanese (one, ""Space Cowboys,"" was in English with Japanese subtitles).  One TV channel even offered a map with up-to-date trip details (weather, speed, distance still to travel, etc.) in the same vein as is found on airlines. <br> <br>As there are extremely few seats available on the ferry outside the dormitories, most people slept or read in their dorm places on the floor.<br> <br>There is a small white map taped to the gray metal side of the large double-sided TV display in the reception area which shows the ferry schedule in relation to the various islands near which the route passes.  Even though one might not know the name of the island (as only Japanese characters are shown), one would still know what time to watch for an island on the horizon.  Perhaps half a dozen islands can be seen along the route.  But the most interesting part of the route is the transit through Tokyo Bay itself.  This takes some 2 1/2 or 3 hours, and the very active Haneda Airport and the very active port of Yokohama are both seen.<br> <br>Once the ferry is outside Tokyo Bay the water quickly becomes rougher.  I strongly recommend wearing an ear patch, which worked well for me.  There is a lot of sea spray once outside Tokyo Bay; so if one spends much time on deck, he can probably expect to get at least a little damp.<br> <br>There is an information office in the ferry terminal upon arrival at Chichi-jima, and baggage can be stowed there.  This office also offers free Ogasawara rubber date stamps which one can use on his passport to mark entry and exit.  Beware the date on the exit stamp, however.  It is always kept one week ahead of the current date.  The apparent assumption is that everyone stays on the island for one week. <br> <br>Upon arrival at Chichi-jima, my 297th TCC destination, I walked to the left through the long park with lovely grass and trees.  Perhaps a third of a mile away is a nice museum in the visitor's center.  One can just follow the paved path and the signs will lead him to the museum.  The actual entrance of the muesum is a little hard to find, but it's there.  The museum attendant spoke excellent English. <br> <br>I wound up having a lovely picnic in the park which is in back of a lovely protected white sandy beach.<br> <br>A short walk in the opposite direction (to the right) from the ferry terminal is a marine research aquarium, but I couldn't figure out how to get in.  I hung around long enough to see some Japanese also walk away without getting in.  Around the bay in that same direction is a place where sea turtles are raised.  I had no transportation and so I didn't try to see it. <br> <br>On my return ferry there were perhaps only 100 passengers.  The same routine applied in terms of trading my exchange order for a boarding pass at the window in the passenger terminal.  This was allowed two hours prior to departure, but boarding was allowed only 20 minutes prior to the 5:00 p.m. departure.<br> <br>On leaving Chichi-jima, four smaller boats sailed with us until the edge of the harbor.  As most passengers on the ferry had just spent a week or more diving and/or fishing at one of the local resorts, I imagine that each boat was from a different resort.  The staff were on board the boats waving goodbye.  Surprisingly, at the harbor's edge two men and one women dived off one of the boats as a farewell gesture! <br> <br>The trip from Tokyo to Chichi-jima was 25 1/2 hours as scheduled.  The return trip was 25 hours and 10 minutes.  The museum attendant in Chichi-jima told me that on its inaugural run the ferry apparently ran flat out from Tokyho and arrived in Chichi-jima 3 hours early. <br> <br>After my trip to Ogasawara I stayed at the Holiday Inn Tobu Narita Airport which was 11,550 yen or approx. USD 102 including taxes and service for a single without breakfast.  This hotel featured CNN and airport transfers. <br> <br>My travel agent, Barbara Stein of Post Haste Travel Virtuoso, 4415 Sheridan St., Hollywood, FL 33021-3513 (tels. 1-800-881-7690, 1-954-966-7690, fax 1-954-966-7706), arranged my entire trip.

17,23,"""Exotic Vietnam,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2006<BR><BR> <P >Exotic Vietnam with its beautiful topography, unique sights, friendly people and excellent shopping, makes for a very interesting tourist destination. As large as the U. S. states of Virginia , North Carolina and South Carolina combined, Vietnam offers many different types of terrain. There are mountains, dense jungles, coastal plains and also river delta. One of the thinnest countries in the world, Vietnam is 2,600 km long; but the width varies between only 60 km and 200 km, except in the far north where it is much wider. <BR><BR>Most tourists will be interested in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Saigon) in the South, Hanoi in the North, and the central region containing the seaport of Danang, the historical capital of Hue and the charming town of Hoi An. In addition, the Central Highlands may be of interest to those with additional time; and beautiful Halong Bay in the North will be viewed by those arriving in Vietnam via ship.<BR><BR>Vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam and one of the most thriving cities in Southeast Asia, was built on a bend in the Saigon River. With a population of nearly seven million, 300-year-old Ho Chi Minh City is the nation's economic heart. <BR><BR>At one time on a par with Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City has been called the Paris of the East. Today it boasts colorful markets where everything from French baguettes to lacquer boxes is sold. Waves of motorbikes flow past the city's French-built architectural landmarks such as the neo-Classical Notre Dame Cathedral, completed in 1880, and the French-era municipal theatre and city hall. <BR><BR>Fortunately, the sights of central Saigon can be reached on foot in less than half an hour from any of the hotels in the city center. The tourist circuit usually includes Reunification Hall (formerly the presidential palace before the 1975 fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese), the Rex Hotel (frequented by American soldiers prior to ""liberation""), the historical museum, the central market, Cholon (Chinatown), the war remnants museum (housed in the building formerly occupied by the U. S. Information Service), and one or more of the city's 200 pagodas. <BR><BR>At Cu Chi, 70 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, there is a network of more than 200 km of man-made tunnels which once allowed the Viet Cong to wage war on Saigon. This is a popular half-day excursion. These fascinating passages, enlarged in places after the Vietnam War to accommodate the larger bodies of foreign tourists, contained underground hospitals, kitchens, sleeping and living quarters and arms storage centers. <BR><BR>Hanoi, the charming and laid-back capital city with its tree-lined boulevards, elegant squares, old colonial-era buildings, lakes, and parks, was built on the Red River about 100 km inland from the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea. Tourist highlights include the Temple of Literature (founded in 1070 and dedicated to Confucious), the old, so-called French Quarter in central Hanoi with its maze of narrow alleys, Hoa Lo Prison (also known as the ""Hanoi Hilton"" which once housed U. S. prisoners of war, including U. S. Senator John McCain), Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and museum (including his modest house and the former presidential palace in which he refused to live), and national museums for history and the arts. <BR><BR>Danang, Hue and Hoi An are clustered in the central region of Vietnam. It is logical to break one's air journey at Danang when flying between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. <BR><BR>Danang, a major seaport and Vietnam's fourth largest city, is known for Marble Mountain, China Beach and the Cham Museum. Marble Mountain is the collective name by which five nearby limestone crags with marble outcrops are known. China Beach, 1 km from Marble Mountain and but one of Vietnam's many fine white sandy beaches, was a popular American R & R destination during the Vietnam War. The Cham Museum, constructed in Danang by the French in 1916, contains art and architecture from the Cham Dynasty of the second century A. D. <BR><BR>Hue, Vietnam's capital between 1802 and 1945, is located on the Perfume River some 108 km north of Danang and 100 km south of the Seventeenth Parallel which once separated North Vietnam from South Vietnam. Although invaded by the French and the Japanese and then later bombed by the U. S. in 1968, many tombs and other historical monuments still remain in and around the former Imperial City. <BR><BR>Historic Hoi An, 32 km south of Danang, has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Vietnam. This small and intimate town can be explored easily on foot. Originally settled by Chinese and Japanese merchants in the sixteenth century, Portuguese and Dutch ships also called there. However, by the end of the nineteenth century Danang finally eclipsed Hoi An in importance as the river which runs through Hoi An began to silt up. The Japanese covered bridge, dating to the sixteenth century, is Hoi An's most-photographed monument.<BR><BR>For those with additional time, the Central Highlands will also beckon. This lush area offers some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in Vietnam. The French used this region as a hill station due to its favorable climate with warm days and cool nights. Interestingly, this region is home to as many as 35 of only 50 or so ethnic groups that exist in all of Vietnam .<BR><BR>Finally, those lucky enough to visit Vietnam via ship (and those willing to undertake a long day trip from Hanoi) are likely to encounter the scenic turquoise waters of Halong Bay near the port of Haiphong in the North. Over 3,000 limestone islets dot the bay. Some islets have miniscule beaches and some have spectacular caves and grottoes. Most islets are covered with lush vegetation. It has been said that Halong Bay, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, is the most beautiful location in all of Vietnam .<BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES: </B> <BR><BR>In Cairo the Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam will only issue 14-day single-entry tourist visas. Tourists requiring a longer period of stay must request an extension after arrival in Vietnam. <BR><BR>Another important concern is that Vietnam tourist visas are issued in Cairo strictly no more than 15 days prior to entry into Vietnam. Because of this restriction, travelers planning multi-country itineraries may be forced to spend time in Vietnam prior to touring other countries in Southeast Asia. In fact, travelers should give consideration to combining a visit to Thailand and/or Angkor Wat in Cambodia with their trip to Vietnam. Air routings to Vietnam typically include Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.<BR><BR>The best time to visit Ho Chi Minh City is between December and April. This is the dry season, although there is still occasional rain even then. April is the hottest and most humid month. The wet season runs from May to November, with the wettest period lasting from June to September.<BR><BR>The best time to visit Hanoi is during the dry season between late September and December or else in March and April. January and February are cool and drizzly. May to September is the rainy season when the heat can be oppressive.<BR><BR>The best time to visit the Central Highlands is from December to February, and the very best time to visit Danang and Hue on the coast is in April. Danang and Hue are deluged by the southwest monsoon in October while the northeast monsoon affects the central coast from December to February. <BR><BR> <BR>Ted Cookson </P><P >Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt </P><P >8 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P>",561
18,23,"""Norfolk Island,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2006 </P><P >People sometimes ask me which is my favorite place in the world. Without hesitation I usually reply that Norfolk Island is my favorite spot. Not only is the island extremely scenic, but its history is fascinating, being intertwined with the Mutiny on the Bounty saga. <BR><BR>Situated between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia, beautiful 34.6-kilometer-square (13.3-mile-square) Norfolk Island is a self-governing territory of Australia. In the fifteenth century Polynesian settlers remained on the island for perhaps a century and then departed mysteriously. Banana trees, stone tools and the Polynesian rat provide evidence for their presence. <BR><BR>Captain James Cook, the European discoverer of Norfolk Island, landed on the island in 1774 during his second voyage to the South Pacific. Cook was under the impression that the native Norfolk Island pine trees would provide excellent masts for ships of the Royal Navy, and he thought that the island's flax plants would yield material for ships' sails. Unfortunately, history proved Cook wrong. The Norfolk Island pines had too many knots to make strong masts, and it was too difficult to prepare the flax plants for manufacturing. <BR><BR>In order to foil possible French settlement of Norfolk Island, the island's first European settlers were sent in March 1788. This was only three months after the British settlement of Australia in January 1788. The original party of 15 convicts and seven free men was later supplemented with additional convicts, and the island's grain and vegetables were sent back to Sydney in order to relieve the conditions of starvation there. <BR><BR>By 1792, after successive waves of convict setlement on Norfolk Island, the island's population exceeded 1,000. Some of these were convicts who elected to stay on as free farmers after serving out their sentences. However, due to its remoteness and the absence of a safe harbor, almost all of the population was transferred to Tasmania by 1813. <BR><BR>In 1825 Norfolk Island was repopulated with convicts who had been convicted of further crimes after arriving in Australia. During this 30-year second penal settlement, Norfolk Island's remoteness was viewed as a plus as Norfolk was then the ultimate punishment short only of death. Living and working conditions were horrifying, food was scarce, and even trivial infractions were punished excessively. The last convicts were transported to Tasmania finally in May 1855. <BR><BR>Little more than a year later, June 1856 marked the arrival of the residents of an overpopulated Pitcairn Island. All were descendants of the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian wives. Although some of these families elected to return to Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863, even today roughly half of Norfolk's population of about 1,900 is descended from those Pitcairn Island immigrants. Norfolk Island's population also grew in the nineteenth century as whalers stayed on when their ships called at the island to resuppply. <BR><BR>The New Zealand army garrisoned Norfolk Island during World War II, and an airbase was built on the island. Fortunately, Norfolk was never attacked during the war.<BR><BR>Norfolk Island has been self-governing since 1979. Australia controls the island's foreign affairs. Sponsorship by a current resident is necessary in order to obtain residency. Alternatively, one can apply for residency by investing in an island business. Although the government is run from Kingston, Burnt Pine is the main commercial center. Education is available only through secondary school. <BR><BR>English is the main language on Norfolk. However, the islanders also speak Norfuk, which is a Creole consisting of eighteenth-century English and the Tahitian language.<BR><BR>There is air service to Norfolk Island from Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle and Auckland. Some 80 km (50 miles) of roads exist on Norfolk. A number of interesting historical and cultural tours are run by local tour operators. Most visitors arrive from Australia and New Zealand on one-week package tours. The importation of fresh fruit and vegetables to Norfolk Island is prohibited. Also, interestingly, non-Australian visitors who come to Norfolk Island from Australia require a multiple entry visa in order to return to Australia! <BR><BR><BR></P><P >Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>21 June 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A> </P>",46
19,23,"""Miniscule Monaco,"" written by Ted Cookson for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt in September 2006<BR> <BR>Covering less than two square kilometers (half a square mile), this principality is nothing if not picturesque. Playground of the rich and famous, Monaco owes its existence to the elegant Monte Carlo Casino, the principality's primary tourist attraction. The casino was built in 1878 by Charles Garnier, the architect who also designed the Paris Opera. Nowadays the casino's ornate nineteenth-century decor can be savored by anyone at least 21 years old who is willing to don a jacket, show his passport, and pay an admission fee. <BR><BR>The capital of the principality, also called Monaco, sits some 180 meters (585 feet) above sea level on a kilometer-long rock. The Palais Princier (Prince's Palace), located in the medieval-looking Old Town on the Rock of Monaco, may be toured during the summer only. A changing of the guard ceremony takes place outside the palace daily at 11:55 a.m. Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace are both entombed in the nearby Cathedrale de Monaco. The Musee Oceanographique (the Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium), also a scientific research institute long directed by Jacques Cousteau, is well worth a visit. The museum building itself has a classical facade, and the exotic species it contains are interesting. The museum was begun by the current prince's great-grandfather, the scholar-prince Albert I, who was an explorer with a strong interest in marine biology. <BR><BR>The Exhibition of the Prince of Monaco's Private Collection of Classic Cars boasts over one hundred very fancy vehicles. Containing everything from carriages dating back to the 1880s to the vehicle which won the first Grand Prix de Monaco in 1929 to the Rolls Royce Silver Cloud which transported Prince Rainier and Princess Grace on the day of their wedding, this museum will appeal to automobile enthusiasts. <BR><BR>Perhaps the most unique attraction in the principality is the Exotic Garden of Monaco. This cactus garden is accessed by paths which snake down the edge of a steep cliff. In the winter the African crassulas and aloes blossom, while during the spring and summer the cacti are at their best. The Exotic Garden contains over a thousand plants gathered from arid regions the world over, including the American Southwest, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Far East. The garden's panoramic views of Monaco and the French and Italian Riviera are a bonus. <BR><BR>The Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology, established in 1902 by Prince Albert I, was opened in the Exotic Garden in 1955. The museum contains prehistoric remains excavated in Monaco. Nearby is the large natural Observatory Cave. Human and animal remains were discovered in this cave, which was inhabited over 200,000 years ago. <BR><BR>Monaco offers several other museums too. A naval museum contains models of ships. The Musee des Timbres et des Monnaies (Stamp and Coin Museum) displays rare stamps from the prince's collection plus coins, notes and medals dating back to 1640. The rather unusual ""national museum"" features the world's most complete collection of mechanical dolls. Most of the 2,000 or so objects in the national museum are from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. <BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES:<BR></B><BR>From September through November the temperature in Monaco is warm, although afternoon temperatures decrease by November. Visitors should expect daytime rainstorms, especially in October and November. From December through February the weather is mild and wet, with daytime rainstorms, especially in December. From March through May Monaco is mild to warm with occasional rain. From June through August the weather is dry and hot. Although rain is rare in the summer, there can be an occasional rainstorm. In the summer the temperature of the Mediterranean rises to 20 C./68 F. in June, 21 C./70 F. in July, 23 C./73 F. in August, and 21 C./70 F. in September. <BR><BR>In July 2006 round trip airfare from Cairo to Nice, France was approximately USD 770 on Air France via Paris and on Alitalia via Milan. Monaco, which makes a lovely day trip from Nice, is 15 minutes from Nice Airport via helicopter or about 30 minutes from downtown Nice by train. To conserve space, Monaco's very modern train station is situated in a tunnel. <BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO MONACO:<BR><BR>Monaco is served by Nice International Airport. The principality is only a 15-minute helicopter flight or a 30-minute train ride from Nice.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",298
20,23,"-""A Mississippi River Steamboat Cruise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2005<BR> <BR>At one point in yesteryear's era of grandeur and elegance over 1,200 steamboats plied the great rivers of America's heartland. In April 2005 I enjoyed a three-day cruise on the Mississippi River on one of America's only three remaining overnight steamboats. <BR><BR>From the river bank the luxurious <I>American Queen</I> resembles a white, six-deck wedding cake. Operated by the Delta Queen Steamboat Company which can trace its roots back to 1890, the vessel, 418 feet long, 95 feet wide and with a draft of ten feet, is listed by Guinness World Records as the largest steamboat ever constructed. <BR><BR>Costing USD$65,000,000 to build in 1995, the <I>American Queen</I> carries 436 passengers and a crew of 160. With 222 staterooms and two elevators, this steamboat is very senior-friendly. The steamboat has a large red wooden paddlewheel in the stern which is powered by a steam engine (salvaged from another vessel and purchased at auction) built half a century ago. Supplemental power is supplied by two diesel outboard motors. On my cruise the speed while traveling up the Mississippi was only eight miles an hour. However, while cruising downstream, the speed picked up to twelve miles an hour! At these speeds it was enjoyable to relax in a chair on the deck in front of one's stateroom and soak in the scenery as it slowly crept by.<BR><BR>The atmosphere of the <I>American Queen</I> transports its passengers back to the nineteenth century, an era of extravagance when steamboating was at the height of its popularity. The grand staircase, ornate chandeliers, grand dining room and elegant staterooms uphold the best traditions of the steamboat era when passengers were drawn from afar to experience the luxury and excitement of river travel. <BR><BR>The <I>American Queen</I>'s Grand Saloon was inspired by small opera houses and by Ford's Theatre, the Washington, D. C. institution where Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. The ladies' parlor, the chart room and the gentlemen's card room all feature original antiques as do the staterooms themselves. The Engine Room Bar is also decorated in a style appropriate to the period. The boat even boasts a calliope.<BR><BR>During my Mississippi cruise I was entertained by music typical of the river (including the song ""Ol' Man River""), authentic Cajun music, Gospel music and even a Beatles show! A Cajun comic came aboard; and there was Mardi Gras revelry, which was appropriate since the cruise began and ended in New Orleans.<BR><BR>From New Orleans, with its world-renowned Creole and Cajun cuisine, ornate French quarter architecture and legendary jazz music, I cruised north to Baton Rouge, the state capital of Louisiana. Just adjacent to our dock in Baton Rouge was the U. S. S. <I>Kidd</I>, a restored World War II destroyer. En route one morning I disembarked from the <I>American Queen</I> where it had tied up below a grass-covered levee.<I> </I>Walking over the levee and down a shady oak-lined path, I toured the picturesque Oak Alley Plantation, said to be one of the most photographed locations in the South. The plantation's great house was completed in 1939.<BR><BR>Themed river cruises are quite popular on the many of the seven-day or longer itineraries of the <I>American Queen</I> and the Delta Queen Steamboat Company's other two steamboats, the <I>Delta Queen</I> and the <I>Mississippi Queen</I>. Passengers are drawn by musical themes (Bluegrass Jamboree, Legends of the 1950s, Big Band, etc.) and historical themes (Civil War, Legends of American History, World War II Remembrance and Veterans' Reunion, etc.). Seasonal themes (Gardens of the South, Kentucky Derby, Fall Foliage, etc.) and miscellaneous themes (Golf, Patchwork, Wine and Food, etc.) are also favorites.<BR><BR>A fun and relaxing river cruise on a paddlewheel steamboat is a unique experience. It is a marvelous way to relive America's nineteenth-century past while savoring the legendary luxury and excitement of river travel. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P><P > Ted Cookson </P>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt</P>8 January 2008<BR><A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""><BR> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P>",112

We were sitting comfortably in a massive 48-seat, butane-heated tundra buggy while en route to view the annual autumn <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> migration. After spending one night at the gateway city of Winnipeg on 21 October, we had flown north on a 40-seat Hawker Siddeley prop jet from Winnipeg to Churchill early the next morning. <BR><BR>Billed as the <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">capital</SPAN></SPAN> of the world, Churchill, with a population of 1,500, is accessible both by air and via the Hudson Bay Railway. The 1,000-mile/1,600-km-long rail line was completed across the permafrost in 1929 by a crew of 3,000. Today, because the 36-hour train journey consumes a full two nights and one day in each direction, many tourists feel that the 2 3/4-hour, 650-mile/1,045-km one-way flight is a more desirable transportation option. <BR><BR>Discovered in 1619 and the site of a Hudson's Bay Company fort constructed in 1688, Churchill grew into a fur-trading port. Then, after construction of the railway some 75 years ago, much of the wheat grown in Saskatchewan and Manitoba was exported via the port of Churchill to Europe, Africa and beyond. In fact, Churchill was once one of the largest grain-exporting ports in the world. Nowadays, tourism plays a significant role in the economy since Churchill lies astride a <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> migration route. <BR><BR>During the 45 minutes that it took Stu to drive our tundra buggy from Churchill out to the shore of Hudson Bay, he conveyed much information about <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears to the participants in our group tour. <BR><BR>The Latin name of the <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> is <I>Ursus maritimus</I> or ""sea <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN>.""

The adult female <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> is smaller, weighing from 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kg) and reaching a length of 5 feet to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.5 m).<BR><BR><SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears range across the Arctic regions of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Norway and Russia where they hunt the ringed seal, the most common seal in the Arctic. It is estimated that the current world <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> population is about 25,000. <BR><SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears have an excellent sense of smell and also keen senses of hearing and eyesight. Their small ears and small tail help prevent heat loss. <BR><BR><SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim as far as 60 miles (96 km) without resting. In fact, the bears' massive forepaws, measuring up to a foot in diameter, are partially webbed to assist in swimming. <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears' fat layer, some 3 to 4 1/2 inches (8 to 11 cm) thick, both provides insulation against the cold and increases buoyancy in the water. <BR><BR>Female <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears normally give birth to two cubs. While mating occurs in the spring, delayed implantation doesn't take place until the fall which is also when the female <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> digs her maternity den in a snow bank. Infant <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears, covered with white hair, typically weigh only a pound ( 0.5 kg) or so and measure from 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm). But, when the mother and cubs leave their den in March, the cubs weigh up to 30 pounds ( 13.6 kg) and have thick fur.<BR><BR><SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> cubs nurse for at least 20 months. During this period they must learn from their mothers how to patiently await the return of a seal to its breathing hole in the ice. In lower Arctic regions mothers wean their cubs as they approach the age of two. On the other hand, in higher Arctic regions where conditions are more difficult, mothers care for their cubs for a third year. <BR><BR>Starvation is believed to be the leading cause of death for sub-adults, those bears which have not yet reached maturity at age five or six. But those <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears which do survive to adulthood have learned to hunt well. The annual mortality rate of adult bears is only 5% annually. <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears, whose sole enemy is man, generally live 15 to 18 years in the wild. <BR><BR>After fasting for several months on land following the mid-July break up of ice on Hudson Bay, <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears begin migrating back to the shore of Hudson Bay in late September. More bears continue to arrive during October and early November. This is the best season for close-up viewing of <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears near the shore in the vicinity of Churchill. With their natural sense of curiosity, the bears generally will not flee a slow-approaching tundra buggy; and, in fact, sometimes they will even lean up on a tundra buggy to try to sniff the occupants! In November when the ice finally forms again on Hudson Bay, the bears go out to hunt for ringed seals, their main prey. At that point <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> viewing can only be done at a great distance with binoculars as the tundra buggies cannot follow the bears out onto the ice. <BR><BR>Fifteen <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears were spotted during the two full-day tundra buggy drives our tour group took near Churchill. This figure double-counts bears seen on both days. Toward the end of our tour Stu advised us that, although normally he would have expected us to see more than 15 bears, we were lucky because we had witnessed interesting interactions between some of the bears. In particular, we had been fortunate to see one group of three sub-adult males mock wrestling with one another for an extended period. Kelsey referred to these bears as ""the Scrappy Brothers"" or ""the Scrappies."" Sometimes these wrestling bears even stood up on their hind legs briefly while trying to bite and paw one another. <BR><BR>We also saw <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears sun themselves while lying around on kelp beds. In fact, sometimes they even gnawed on the kelp itself. We watched as one <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> swam out into Hudson Bay. Unusually, that <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> captured a duck, which was consumed on the spot. <BR><BR><SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">Polar</SPAN></SPAN> bears which happen to wander into the town of Churchill are darted, put into wheeled tubular cages fitted with trailer hitches, and then held in an old aircraft hangar for up to a month until they are transported back out onto the tundra far from town. While in captivity in what is known locally as the "" <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> jail"", the animals are given access to water or snow but not to food. The idea behind this form of tough love is to provide the bears with a negative memory of their contact with man so that they will not be inclined to return. <BR><BR>In addition to bears, our tour group spotted caribou, Arctic hare, snowy owl, ptarmigan and raven on the tundra in the vicinity of Churchill. Stu said that our caribou sighting was only the second of the season. <BR><BR>The cheapest weekend <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">polar</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN class=st0><SPAN id=st style=""BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%; BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT: scroll"" name=""st"">bear</SPAN></SPAN> adventure package is priced at about USD 1,400 per person in double and features round trip airfare between Winnipeg and Churchill, Manitoba, two days of sightseeing in a tundra buggy with lunch, and one night at a hotel in Churchill.

22,23,"<body><p>""<b>Malta, a Jewel in the Mediterranean</b>,"" written for the   expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2009 </p><p>Strategic Malta is situated in the Mediterranean Sea 93 km (58 miles) south of Sicily and 300 km (186 miles) north of Libya.  A member of the European Union since 1994, this tiny republic consists of three limestone islands:  246-square-km (94-square-mile) Malta, 61-square-km (24-square-mile) Gozo, and 3-square-km (1-square-mile) Comino.  The sprawling capital of Valletta and most of the national population of 403,000 are located on the island of Malta, which measures 27 km (17 miles) by 14.5 km (9 miles).  On the other hand, Gozo's population is only 31,000; and a mere eight people reside on Comino.  <br><br>Because barren Malta boasts no mountains, lakes or rivers, half of its fresh water requirements must be supplied through reverse osmosis.  Malta's two official languages are the Semitic Malti and English.  The latter is a reflection of the British presence in Malta from 1798 to 1979.  <br><br>Malta was first populated about 5000 B. C.  Between 3600 B. C. and 2,500 B. C. a number of stone temples were constructed, about two dozen of which still survive.  Malta was a Phoenician colony between 800 B. C. and 218 B. C.  Then, after the fall of Carthage, these islands were controlled by Rome.  The Arabs ruled from 870 A. D. until their expulsion in 1090 by King Roger of Sicily.  The Knights of St. John arrived in 1530 and remained for 268 years.  Napoleon held Malta for a two-year period from 1798.  This was followed by British rule until late in the twentieth century.  <br><br>The most famous event in Malta's history is the Great Siege of 1565 when an Ottoman fleet appeared carrying 30,000 men.  After a bloody three-month siege, relief finally arrived from Sicily; so the Ottomans withdrew.  Malta also suffered five months of severe bombing in 1942.<br><br>At the crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea, Malta's rich and fascinating history is a big draw for tourists.  The sunny climate is another factor which has contributed to the creation of a substantial tourism industry.  Over a million tourists visit Malta annually, and tourism represents up to 40% of Malta's gross national product.  Probably best known for its spectacular Grand Harbor, Malta's other top tourist sites include:  the baroque St. John's Co-cathedral constructed in 1573; the Grand Master's Palace built in 1571; star-shaped Fort St. Elmo at the mouth of the harbor; and the waterfront district of Vittoriosa.  Casa Rocca Piccola in downtown Valletta is also well worth a visit.  Constructed in the 1580s for the Knights of St. John, its current owner is a member of the de Piro Family.  The house may be viewed only by guided tour.<br><br>In the interior of Malta is the medieval walled village of Mdina, which today has a population of only 400.  Mdina's primary attraction is the baroque St. Paul's Cathedral built between 1697 and 1702.<br><br>Since flying time from Cairo is only two hours, Malta is ideal for a 3-day or 4-day getaway.  It is best to visit during the dry season months of April, May, June, September and October.  July and August are also good, although it is hotter then.  From November through February is the rainy season, with most precipitation falling in December and January.  Round trip airfare from Cairo to Malta on Egypt Air is EGP 2,500.  Egypt Air flies both ways on Thursday and Sunday.  Travel on any other day of the week requires a change of aircraft in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.  Travelers with a full week to spare should consider combining Malta with nearby Sicily.  Round trip ferries between Malta and Sicily begin from about Euro 100.<font size=""3""> </font><span style=""color: black""> </span></p><font size=""4""><a target=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtYjRq_fQjc"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=bpFX2yl6vkk"">Sailaway from Malta's Grand Harbor, 112-second video clip</a></font><br> <p>  <span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman""><b>Ted Cookson<br>  Manager - Maadi<br>  Egypt Panorama Tours<br>  Cairo, Egypt<br>  21 May 2009<br>  <a href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com</a><br>  <a href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com</a> </b></p></body>",294
23,23,"""The Road to Timbuktu,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in May 2008<br /> <span style=""color: black""><br />Inaccessible Timbuktu served as a siren for European travelers for centuries. Between 1588 and 1880 some four dozen Europeans attempted to reach the fabled city. However, only four succeeded. The Scotsman Major Alexander Gordon Laing was the first to reach Timbuktu, in 1826. Laing remained for six weeks but was murdered by Tuareg in the Sahara on his homeward journey, only two days north of town. The Frenchman Rene Caillie, who only set off posing as a Muslim only after first having studied Arabic in Senegal, reached Timbuktu in 1828. Caillie became the first European to visit Timbuktu and then return to Europe successfully. The German Heinrich Barth arrived in 1853 disguised as a Tuareg during the course of his five-year exploration of the Sahara. After a stay of nearly a year, Barth also managed to return to Europe via caravan. The fourth explorer, the Austrian Oscar Lenz, arrived in 1880. <br /><br />Founded in the eleventh century by Tuareg nomads, Timbuktu's strategic location in present-day Mali south of the Sahara near the northern bend of the Niger River facilitated its growth into an important commercial center. At the southern end of the trans-Saharan camel caravan route leading up to the Mediterranean, Timbuktu prospered greatly from trade. Gold, slaves, ivory, kola nuts and ostrich feathers from the south were exchanged for salt, cloth, copper, tin and horses from the north. In 1494 the traveler Leo Africanus noted that the many doctors, judges and imams residing in Timbuktu were well-maintained by the Songhai king. By the middle of the sixteenth century Timbuktu's population burgeoned under Songhai rule, and the rich city could boast of having 150 Islamic schools with many thousands of students from all over West Africa. The 1591 invasion by a musket-equipped Moroccan mercenary army signaled the beginning of Timbuktu's decline. At about this same time European ships began to arrive off the West African coast, destroying the centuries-old trans-Saharan trade monopoly. Drought, famine and unstable government then became a way of life until the French took control three centuries later, in 1894. However, by that time Tikmbuktu's glory days were long over and the city's significance on the world stage was but a historical footnote. Today it is tourism on which Timbuktu manages to survive. <br /><br />I traveled from Cairo to Timbuktu in January 2008, flying first to Bamako, the capital of Mali, on comfortable Kenya Airways 737 jets via Nairobi. After an overnight in Bamako so I could tour the market and the excellent national museum, I continued on Air Malienne, a domestic airline which wet leases its sole prop jet with an English-speaking crew from a South African charter carrier. The airport at Timbuktu with its new terminal building is not far from town, so it didn't take long to reach the sandy streets of the old city, which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1992. <br /><br />Three of the oldest mosques in West Africa are in Timbuktu. The most ancient of these mud-brick structures is the Dyingerey Ber Mosque, built in 1325 by an Andalusian architect by order of the Malian king, Kankan Moussa, after his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Dyingerey Ber Mosque is currently being renovated with the assistance of the Agha Khan Cultural Trust. Sidi Yahiya Mosque and the Sankore Mosque were constructed during the fifteenth century. The latter housed Timbuktu's well-known Sankore University, one of the largest educational institutions in the Muslim world during the sixteenth century. Today the houses where the most famous European explorers stayed are all identified by prominent plaques. While the former residences of Laing and Caillie cannot be entered and not much remains of the house of Lenz, Barth's home is now a small museum. Timbuktu is also known for its ancient Islamic manuscript collections. The Ahmed Baba Center for Historical Research contains over 15,000 such manuscripts, the oldest of which, a document of Islamic law, dates to 1204! There are also some collections of early Islamic manuscripts in Timbuktu which remain in private hands.<br /><br />Mali, the largest country in West Africa with 1.2 million square km, has more to offer the traveler than just Timbuktu. For most tourists the road to Timbuktu also passes through Djenne and ""Dogon Country,"" both of which can be reached from the river port of Mopti, also served by Air Malienne. In fact, a pinasse (boat) tour of Mopti, situated on the Bani River near its junction with the Niger River, shouldn't be missed. In Mopti it is fascinating to view the busy riverbanks and the other pinasses which contain all manner of cargos, including live animals, firewood, dried fish, and even large salt slabs that have been transported up the Niger from Timbuktu! <br /><br />Picturesque Djenne, founded in the thirteenth century on an island in the Bani River, once rivaled Timbuktu; and the political fortunes of the two cities ran in parallel. Djenne was designated a World Heritage Site in 1988. Today, with a population of 10,000, Djenne is known for its colorful Monday market and for its very impressive mosque. The Djenne Mosque was constructed in 1907 on the site of another mosque dating back to the thirteenth century. Featuring three minarets, the Djenne Mosque, raised some three meters above the ground level of the market which it faces, is the world's largest mud building! <br /><br />In spite of Timbuktu's world-wide name recognition, it is so-called ""Dogon Country"" which is the most-visited area of Mali. Some 400,000 Dogon tribesmen today cultivate millet, rice, sorghum and onions and raise their livestock on the 4,000 square km of plains and plateau which surround the 200-km-long Bandiagara Escarpment. These are said to be the ancestors of people who had arrived there by at least the fifteenth century. Traditionally the Dogon people built cliff villages for defensive purposes. Today, however, many Dogon also live in villages on the Dogon Plateau.<br /><br />The village of Sangha, where there is a simple but clean hotel, makes an excellent base for exploring Dogon Plateau villages such as Songo and one or more of the cliff villages such as Banani constructed at the base of the Bandiagara Escarpment. Dogon villages are composed of clusters of buildings organized by clan. The buildings include houses made of mud and rock, raised granaries with conical straw roofs, and storerooms. Each village also contains a low-roofed, nine-pillared open meeting room for village elders as well as shrines and other unique structures. The spiritual beliefs and symbolism of the animistic Dogon culture are unique, and local guides help to explain the various complicated Dogon circumcision, cult and death rituals. Village inhabitants attempt to sell homemade artifacts such as masks, wooden doors and jewelry to tourists during their visit.<br /><br />Colorful and rich in history, Mali, one of West Africa's most interesting destinations, is more accessible than one might think. Bamako, the capital, is now easy to reach by air from Cairo. In addition, Mali boasts excellent two-lane highways with little traffic; and domestic air service is available nearly every day to both Timbuktu and Mopti, the jumping-off point for Djenne and the fascinating Dogon Country. <span style=""color: black""> </span></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 12pt"">11 Mali video clips (none of which is from Timbuktu, unfortunately):<br /><br /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=xaJKuRQ7lBw""><font size=""4"">View of a pinasse (boat) on the Bani River at Mopti, Mali, 21-second video clip</font></a><a target=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtYjRq_fQjc"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=xaJKuRQ7lBw&feature=PlayList&p=885BB18A26FC91FF&index=6""><font size=""4""> 21-second video clip</font></a><font size=""4""> <br /></font><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=3QHQYsYOrT4""><font size=""4"">View from a pinasse (boat) on the Niger River at Mopti, Mali, 62-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=abgjKsSiWMY""><font size=""4"">Pinasse (boat) on Bani River near Mopti, Mali #1, 24-second video clip</font></a><font size=""4""> <br /></font><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCy7VzyoxBI""><font size=""4"">Pinasse (boat) on Bani River near Mopti, Mali #2, 12-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va2aJwzIP8g"">Bani River fishermen near Mopti, Mali, 38-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XdsjQGTb18"">Djenne, Mali car ferry #1, 19-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYe64CQR4M"">Djenne, Mali car ferry #2, 21-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xXOyaWYN1w"">Djenne, Mali car ferry #3, 19-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwXQYPhQuSo"">Boat on Bani River at Djenne, Mali, 23-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaMRzgmlbWU"">Great Mosque of Djenne, Mali, 31-second video clip</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqtVPmPN318"">View over Dogon village of Songo in central Mali, 16-second video clip</a>",390
24,23,"-""Diving in the Maldives,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in November 2002 </P><P >The Republic of Maldives (pronounced ""Mahl'-deevz""), which is situated in the Indian Ocean south of India, consists of some 1,200 small islands grouped into 19 atolls which stretch 750 km/465 miles from north to south. Most of the country lies north of the equator. In addition to the 90 islands occupied only by tourist resorts (one resort per island), over 200 other islands are inhabited by citizens of the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> . Male (pronounced ""Mah'-lee""), the capital, occupies a separate island, and </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Hulhule</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceName>International</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Airport</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> is on yet another island only 2 km/1 mile from Male.<BR><BR> </SPAN></P><P >The low-lying islands of the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> consist of coral which has been built up over thousands of years on the peaks of submerged volcanos. Barrier reefs surround and protect these islands. The atolls of the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> boast gorgeous white sandy beaches and clear lagoons. Many islands, including most of those occupied by tourist resorts, are just tiny palm-covered coral sandbanks, around which you can walk in less than half an hour.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Fishing and tourism are the mainstays of the economy of the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> , which is one of the poorest countries in the world. Tourists usually have no awareness that much of the population lives at a subsistence level. This is due to the fact that the only Maldivians with whom tourists generally come into contact are those working on the tourist resort islands and at the airport. It is not easy for tourists to visit the non-resort islands as doing so requires a special government permit.</SPAN></P><P >Why choose the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> for your diving holiday? Most of the </SPAN> Indian Ocean</SPAN> 's 700 species of fish have been seen by divers in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> . And even as a snorkeler with goggle and fins you can very easily swim up to and admire incredibly colored reef fish and coral gardens.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Also, access to the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> is generally hassle-free as many nationalities are given a free one month visitor permit upon arrival at </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Hulhule</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceName>International</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Airport</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> .</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Furthermore, there is frequent air service to Male in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> on Emirates via </SPAN> Dubai</SPAN> . Qatar Airways also offers service to Male via </SPAN> Doha</SPAN> . For those who would like to explore Qatar briefly without the hassle of obtaining a visa, this latter routing involves a forced 24-hour stay on the return to Cairo with accommodation in Doha at the airline's own expense. For both airlines the cheapest seats normally fill up very far in advance of Christmas, Easter/spring break periods and Islamic holidays. So do plan extremely far ahead in order to minimize airfare. Airline booking computers can accept reservations at least 11 months in advance.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Those dive enthusiasts who prefer to spend a week on a live-aboard dive boat will be glad to know that they can be accommodated in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> . However, since 90% of visitors to the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> spend dive holidays on one of the well-equipped resort islands, it is more likely that you will be a resort-based diver or snorkeler. What are the factors to consider when choosing a dive resort in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> ?</SPAN></P><P ><BR>First, since you must transfer round trip from the airport to your resort, the distance from the airport island to the island on which your resort is located is important. Unless you are willing to spring for expensive transfers by seaplane or by helicopter, then the farther away your resort, the longer you will need to ride in a speedboat (or, for closer resorts, a ""dhoni"" which is a motorized sailboat). Transfers to some of the more distant resorts can involve speedboat rides of several hours each way.</SPAN></P><P >The second factor is the quality of the resort's accommodation and meals. This is often but not always reflected in the price per night. Since each resort island contains nothing else but a resort, it is unlikely that your meals will be taken anywhere other than at your resort. Half board (breakfast and dinner) is allowed at some resorts while full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner) is compulsory at other resorts. Some resorts are also sold on an ""all-inclusive"" basis, which includes most water sports.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Third, consider the size of the resort (the number of beds) and the various facilities offered. Some of the larger resorts even offer such facilities as tennis courts.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Finally, you might also consider the likely nationalities of the your fellow guests. Resorts in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> cater primarily to European clientele - especially to the German, Italian, British and French markets. If you possess foreign language skills, then you might feel more comfortable with guests of one nationality than with another.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>In addition to selecting your resort, you will also want to give some thought as to what season you wish to visit. The </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> has two distinct climatic seasons. The high season, when the winds blow from the northeast and resort prices are generally at their highest, lasts from December through March. February is the driest and also the busiest month. The low season, when the winds blow from the southwest, lasts from late April through October. During this season there are stronger winds and some storms, especially in June. But note that there can be considerable variations.</SPAN></P><P ><BR>Temperatures in the </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> range between 24 C./75 F. and 33 C./91 F. year-round, and the humidity is rather high.</SPAN></P><P >The </SPAN> Maldives</SPAN> is an Islamic nation. However, while it is forbidden to import alcoholic beverages into the country, beer, wine and mixed drinks are readily available for purchase at all resorts. If you do arrive at </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Hulhule</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceName>International</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>Airport</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> with a bottle of alcohol in your possession, it will be confiscated and then returned to you upon your departure from the country!</SPAN></P><P ><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A> </SPAN></P>",460

Its mountains average about 1,220 meters (4,000 feet) but they range all the way up to 1862 meters (6,107 feet), with many deep ravines running out to the coast. </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > has little in the way of good beaches. </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Porto</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Santo</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Island</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN >, on the other hand, is much smaller than </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > but it has an excellent 9 km-long ( 5.6-mile-long) beach. </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > and Porto Santo are the only two inhabited islands in the archipelago. Of the total population of some 250,000, only about 5,000 live on Porto Santo. <BR><BR>Sugar cane was one of the earliest crops grown in the archipelago. By 1514 some 5,000 permanent inhabitants were farming on </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN >. Funchal, with its pretty tile roofs, has always been the main port and capital. With a population of 150,000 inhabitants, Funchal, perhaps named for fennel (""funcho"" in Portuguese) which grew wild there, is situated in a beautiful natural amphitheatre. Sacked by the French in 1566, Funchal was not returned to </SPAN> <SPAN >Portugal</SPAN> <SPAN > until 1662. In 1801 and in 1807 an English fleet temporarily took over Funchal. <BR><BR>Tourism to </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > began in the 1890s and it was at this time that the British began arriving in numbers to reside.

March and April are the peak tourist months in spite of the fact that the best time to visit is during the dry season from May through September. <BR><BR>The highlight of many a tourist's visit to </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > is riding a cable car from Funchal up to Monte and then being pushed 2 km (1.2 miles) back down toward Funchal in a wicker toboggan sledge mounted on two wooden runners. It is thought that Funchal's two-seat wicker toboggan sledges were developed around 1850 for the very practical reason of speeding transport into town. Today's tourists can still thrill to this adrenaline-raising but very safe experience where speeds of up to 48 km (30-miles) per hour can be achieved. The downhill journey from Nossa Senhora do </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Monte</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Church</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN > requires about 10 minutes.

26,23,"-""Libya Tours: The Good News and the Bad News (And How to Lessen the Latter),"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in January 2005<BR><BR><U>IMPORTANT UPDATE: IN LATE 2005 LIBYA CEASED GIVING TOURIST VISAS TO AMERICANS. THE SOLE EXCEPTION WAS DURING THE SOLAR ECLIPSE IN EARLY 2006. AS OF 3 JANUARY 2008 THE VISA SITUATION REMAINS UNCHANGED. HOWEVER, NON-AMERICANS ARE NOT AFFECTED AND MAY TRAVEL TO LIBYA AS PER THE ARTICLE BELOW. </U> </P><P >WHY VISIT LIBYA?<BR><BR> After being all-but-closed to international tourism for a number of years, Libya has now opened its doors again to American and other tourists. Since the limited number of hotel rooms is currently constricting tourist arrivals, now is a great time to visit Libya's amazing antiquities before mass tourism takes hold. <BR><BR><BR><B>THE GOOD NEWS: LIBYA HAS FASCINATING ROMAN RUINS<BR><BR></B>Nearby Libya offers ""world-class"" (1) Roman-era ruins at Leptis Magna and Sabratha near Tripoli, the capital, and (2) Greek-era ruins at Cyrene near Benghazi, the second-largest city. <BR><BR>Tripoli itself contains an interesting archeological and historical museum, and there is an old-style market (souk) in the medina nearby. <BR><BR>Beyond that, Libya's desert oases boast a rich historical and archeological heritage.<BR><BR>That's the good news.<BR><BR><BR><B>THE BAD NEWS: A LIBYA TOUR SEEMS EXPENSIVE<BR><BR></B>The bad news is that, at least at first glance, tour prices for Libya appear to be expensive. In part, this is because tour prices include so many items which would not be prepaid normally unless you were, say, going on safari. <BR><BR>This situation arises because no one (except perhaps a diplomat?) is able to obtain a tourist visa to visit Libya by walking into the Embassy of Libya in Cairo and simply applying for one. A visa for a non-diplomat is only issued to a person who has been ""invited"" by a tour operator in Libya. The activities of the tourist then become the legal responsibility of the tour operator while that tourist remains in Libya.<BR><BR>This being the case, tour operators require that tourists reserve and prepay a complete ""land package"" consisting of (a) round trip airport transfers, (b) a full tour program with a private vehicle and driver plus a guide who speaks the tourist's native language, (c) hotel accommodation, and (d) all meals. Once such a complete land package is prepaid, the tour operator in Libya then arranges to ""invite"" the tourist to Libya. <BR><BR>A few of the more savvy travel agencies shortcut the visa procedure by working with a tour operator in Tripoli who arranges for tourist visas to be made available upon arrival at Tripoli International Airport. Prior to departure a fax is provided to the client. This fax must be shown to the airline as evidence that a visa will be waiting for him/her upon arrival in Tripoli. Without such evidence of visa upon arrival, the client will be denied boarding by the airline in Cairo.<BR><BR><BR><B>WAYS TO MINIMIZE THE PRICE OF A LIBYA TOUR<BR><BR>LAND PACKAGE:<BR><BR></B>Tour pricing can be minimized by reducing the number of days spent in Libya. One can see plenty in only a two-day visit, for instance. The interesting national museum (with archeological, historical and cultural exhibits) and nearby market in Tripoli can be seen on the morning of the first day; and the Roman-era ruins at Sabratha, 60 minutes west of Tripoli, can be visited after lunch that same day. The second day should be devoted to the extensive Roman-era ruins at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes east of Tripoli. There are clean tourist restaurants conveniently situated near Sabratha and Leptis Magna where one can eat the lunch which will be included in your package.<BR><BR>Tour pricing can also be minimized by staying in lesser quality accommodations than you might normally prefer. A few of the 3-star hotels in Tripoli are as clean as the 4-star hotels. Because Tripoli's sole 5-star hotel is so very expensive, almost all travelers' options for accommodation will be limited to 3-star and 4-star hotels anyway. <BR><BR>Finding friends who would like to tour Libya with you will reduce pricing substantially. For example, two people traveling alone can expect to reduce their tour price by about USD 400 <U>per person</U> by finding just one other couple with whom to travel. <BR><BR><BR><B>AIRFARE:<BR><BR></B>Egypt Air is probably the better of the two airlines flying to Libya; but Egypt Air flies between Cairo and Tripoli in both directions in the middle of the night, which is inconvenient. Also, Egypt Air's airfares are related to one's length of stay. So for a short stay Egypt Air is substantially more expensive than Libyan Arab Airlines, the other carrier. Egypt Air's round trip airfares vary from approx. USD 363 for a stay with a minimum of six nights to approx. USD 597 for a stay with a minimum of two nights or less. Libyan Arab Airlines, on the other hand, offers a round trip airfare of approx. USD 334 no matter how long the stay. Ask your travel agent for more information about the various airfares available.<BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO LIBYA:<BR><BR>Tripoli International Airport is Libya's largest. Libya may also be accessed via land from Tunisia or Egypt or via ferry from Malta. Travelers are required to pre-arrange tours and accommodation via a travel agent prior to Libya tourist visa issuance. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",387
27,23,"Note that two articles are included below.<BR><BR>""The Ins and Outs of Kenya Safaris: Everything You Always Wanted to Know but Were Afraid to Ask,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in August 2006 <P >Kenya is far and away the most popular safari destination from Cairo. Many expatriates in Egypt opt to capitalize on their close proximity to East Africa by taking a safari and/or a beach holiday there. <BR><BR><B>GETTING THERE:</B> The best airfare to Nairobi is obtained by flying the same airline round trip. Egypt Air flies nonstop to Nairobi three or four times a week, while Kenya Airways operates daily flights to Nairobi weekly via Khartoum where there is usually a 45-minute stop in transit. (Disembarkation at Khartoum is allowed only for those passengers ending their journey there.) Both airlines offer overnight southbound flights from Cairo to Nairobi. While Egypt Air's nonstop flights would at first glance appear to be more convenient, Kenya Airways offers three big advantages. On most days Kenya Airways provides an early evening northbound return flight while Egypt Air departs Nairobi in the morning. Thus Kenya Airways passengers avoid the expense of a final hotel night in Nairobi. In addition, Kenya Airways passengers don't have to suffer the inconvenience of rising early on the final morning in order to depart from their hotel in downtown Nairobi at 2:45 a.m. to drive to Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for an Egypt Air return flight to Cairo departing at about 5:00 a.m. Finally, because Egypt Air does not fly to any destination in Kenya other than Nairobi, Kenya Airways offers the cheapest airfare to Mombasa and elsewhere on the Kenya coast (and, for that matter, to Zanzibar for anyone wishing to combine a safari with a visit to that lovely and unique spice island).<BR><BR><B>THE SAFARI:</B> A Kenya safari holiday is normally six nights or longer in duration and includes a visit to at least two game reserves and a lake resort in the Great Rift Valley. Other options include a visit to one of the tree hotels near Mt. Kenya, an overnight in Nairobi and/or a visit to Mombasa, Malindi or Lamu on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast. In addition, of course, a visit to Kenya may be combined easily with a beach holiday in the Seychelles or with a visit to another African destination served by Kenya Airways (Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, etc.)<BR><BR>Both lodge accommodation and luxury tents are available in Kenya. Luxury tented accommodation, which costs no less than staying in a lodge, features all of the facilities of a regular hotel room, including furniture, shower and flush toilet. A much less expensive option is a basic tented group camping safari. While the animals are the same no matter where one sleeps, anyone who elects to combine two of the shorter group camping safaris (rather than taking one longer group camping safari) will need to spend an extra hotel night in Nairobi in order to connect.<BR><BR>Whether one stays in lodges or tents, the normal safari routine generally includes three game drives in each game reserve. Morning game drives are taken after an early breakfast, and afternoon game drives are taken around 4 p.m. The drives typically last anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on one's mood and one's luck. The animals tend to be active, drinking and feeding, in the morning and late afternoon. In the middle of the day, while the animals are asleep, visitors relax or take a dip in the pool.<BR><BR><B>THE GAME RESERVES:</B> <BR><BR><B>Masai Mara</B> is considered to be Kenya's premier game reserve. A rolling grassland beautiful to behold, the Mara plays host to the great migration every summer when millions of animals, chief among them wildebeeste, migrate north across Tanzania's Serengeti plain into Kenya's Masai Mara. There is still game aplenty after the animals have returned to the Serengeti by early autumn. A visit to Masai Mara is usually combined with a visit to either Amboseli Game Reserve or Samburu Game Reserve.<BR><BR><B>Amboseli</B> is situated in what was a dry lake bed until the El Nino/La Nina phenomena of the 1990s. The wildlife inhabiting this reserve seeks sustenance near several small streams which run through it. The primary attraction of Amboseli is its proximity to 19,340-foot (6,447-meter) Mt. Kilimanjaro which lies just across the border in Tanzania. With luck, visitors are able to photograph game animals with the mountain as a backdrop. The long rainy season stretches from mid-March until mid-June while the short rains occur from mid-November until early December. The sun normally reappears right after each short downpour.<BR><BR><B>Samburu</B>, on the other hand, is somewhat drier than Masai Mara although it too is rich in game. In fact, Samburu boasts some species of animals seldom seen outside Kenya's North. These include the gerenuk (a long-necked gazelle which feeds while standing up on its hind legs), the reticulated giraffe and Grevy's zebra with its thin stripes. The primary attraction of Samburu for many, however, is leopard. In Samburu several of the lodges bait leopard in the evening; so, with luck, visitors can watch the nighttime predator come to feast on scraps of meat under floodlights.<BR><BR>A Kenya safari also includes a visit to one of the lake resorts in the Great Rift Valley since it is too far to drive comfortably between any two of the three game reserves in a single day. Lake Nakuru, for instance, is famous for its flamingos and pelicans. A rhino sanctuary has also been established there. Nowadays this may be the only opportunity for tourists to view rhino in Kenya.<BR><BR><B>OTHER OPTIONS IN KENYA:</B> So called because they are in essence hotels on stilts, the three tree hotels - The Ark, Mountain Lodge and Treetops - all offer the opportunity to view mountain, forest and nighttime animals as opposed to the plains game seen in the large open parks. The tree hotels are all situated in forests in the vicinity of Mt. Kenya north of Nairobi, and the game viewing routine is the same at them all. Visitors arrive for lunch, perhaps rest briefly in the afternoon, and then before and after dinner until well into the night feast their eyes on the sights and sounds of the various species as they come to drink from the water hole in front of the lodge. Viewing is done from one's bedroom, open balconies, glassed rooms or from an underground blind. It is necessary to bring along warm clothing for a stay at a tree hotel as well as high speed film in order to photograph at night under the floodlights. If one hasn't seen all of the species by bedtime, he can notify the game spotter who will buzz one's room if that leopard does turn up at 3 a.m.! To minimize noise, children less than about seven years of age are not allowed at the tree hotels.<BR><BR>Nairobi, with a population of about two million, offers some excellent shopping. Tourists will find distinctive wood carvings and woven purse baskets for sale at rest stops along the highways in Kenya. Similar items can be found at gift shops at the lodges in the parks, but they will be more expensive there. If one doesn't see what one wants in the bush, it is likely to be found in Nairobi. There one can buy everything from a safari suit to camera lenses. One should be cautioned, however, that Nairobi continues to have a street crime problem. Daytime incidents consist mainly of purse snatching, and it is not advisable to walk any great distance on Nairobi's streets at night. If one elects to overnight in Nairobi, he should consider taking a taxi when going out to eat at one of the city's excellent Indian, seafood or other fine restaurants.<BR><BR>Resort hotels stretch along Kenya's coast both north and south of the island of Mombasa. Diani Beach, Mombasa's best, is a magnificent five-mile stretch of white sand on Mombasa's South Coast. Malindi, further to the north, is a much smaller resort. Lamu, a coastal island far to the north, is a unique destination reminiscent of Zanzibar. Kenya resorts offer the full range of facilities for water sports and diving. <BR><BR><B>WHEN TO GO:</B> The absolute best time to visit Kenya is July-September when the migration is at its peak in Masai Mara. But the game is generally excellent in Kenya even if one cannot travel when the migration is on. Travelers from Egypt tend to visit Kenya from Christmas through March, typically during school holidays.<BR><BR>The other major consideration is climate. Game is easiest to spot during the dry seasons as then the animals can only find water in certain places. The long rainy season stretches from late March until early June while the short rains occur from mid-November until early December. Rain usually occurs in short downpours after which the sun reappears.<BR><BR>Contrarian travelers may benefit by traveling in the long rainy season. During these months there are fewer tourists and less dust. In addition, from April through June lodging rates are usually discounted up to 15%. During the rainy seasons one would expect to encounter all of the animal species but perhaps lesser numbers of each.<BR><BR>Sitting astride the equator which passes north of Nairobi, the temperature in Kenya does not change much over the course of the year. Rather, temperature is a function of altitude. For instance, because Nairobi and Masai Mara are a mile high, they offer a combination of warm days (when short sleeves and short pants are appropriate) and cool nights (when a sweater or a light jacket is appropriate).<BR><BR>Nairobi's average high temperature varies between 81 F./27 C. (March) and 73 F./23 C. (July-August). Nairobi's average low temperature varies between 55 F./13 C. (January-February) and 59 F./15 C. (April-May). Average rainfall in Nairobi varies from 1 inch/3 cm (July-September) to 8 inches/20 cm (April).<BR><BR><B>VISAS AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS:</B> Citizens of the U. K., the U. S., Canada, Egypt and most other countries require tourist visas to visit Kenya. It is recommended that tourists to Kenya be up-to-date in their yellow fever vaccination. In addition, a prophylactic for malaria should be commenced at least one week prior to arrival in Kenya and should be continued for four weeks after returning. The web site of the U. S.

Because Lamu's traditional way of life is still intact, visitors might well experience a bit of culture shock when arriving in this remote spot by air from modern Nairobi or Mombasa.<BR> <BR>Lamu's only vehicle belongs to the district commissioner. Donkeys, of which the island boasts hundreds, are the mainstay of the local transportation system. Lamu is an Islamic community with religious schools teaching Arabic and with several dozen mosques. Typically local women are seen clad in black robes; and they often keep their faces covered in public.<BR> <BR>It is impossible for visitors not to be aware of Lamu's deep sense of history. The settlement was known to the Greeks as Azania as early as the second century. Later, from the ninth century, Persian and Arab traders settled there, helping to form a unique Swahili Arab-African religious community, the culture and way of life of which appear to be much the same today.<BR> <BR>Originally one of the East African trading ports from which slaves, ivory and rhino horn were exported, the first written mention of Lamu was in the fifteenth century. However, most of the buildings still standing in Lamu's historical core today date only from the eighteenth century. During this period Lamu flourished from the export of ivory, mangrove poles, oil seeds, various grains and both cowrie and tortoise shells. The Lamu dhows which sailed east to Arabia and India returned home with silks, spices and porcelain. Lamu continued to prosper into the nineteenth century under the protection of Oman. It was the sultan of Oman who built Lamu's fort in 1820.<BR> <BR>The ending of the slave trade in the 1870s reduced the cheap labor on which Lamu's prosperity had depended. Also, Mombasa and Zanzibar began to grow in importance at about that same time. So toward the end of the nineteenth century Lamu fell into decline. Perhaps because it was isolated from modern technology and materialism during the first half of the twentieth century, Lamu was finally discovered as a tourist destination in the early 1960s.<BR> <BR>Today the story of Lamu is to be seen in the old buildings which line its narrow, cool and quiet streets. Lamu's traditional eighteenth century coral stone Swahili courtyard houses are richly decorated inside. The House Museum, restored by the National Museums of Kenya, provides a fine example of intricately-carved wall niches and ceilings. The Lamu Museum, formerly the house of the British district commissioner, is another tourist highlight, providing a good introduction to the town and to the tribes which live opposite Lamu on the Kenya mainland.<BR> <BR>Lamu Town faces nearby Manda Island where the air strip is situated. Because most visitors arrive by air, their first view of Lamu is from the water. This is appropriate since Lamu's modern economy is based, aside from tourism and forestry (mangrove pole cutting), on shipping, fishing and boat building.<BR> <BR>Two fine 4-star hotels are located in Shela, a suburb which is a 15-minute boat ride or a 45-minute walk away from downtown Lamu. Lesser quality accommodation is available in downtown Lamu itself. Lamu is known for Maulidi, the celebration of the Prophet's birthday. During this week there are religious festivities, feasting and dancing. But during the festival hotel accommodation is at a premium.<BR> <BR>While most visitors to Kenya rightly focus on game viewing, unique Lamu, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also well worth a visit.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com</A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com</A> </P>",383
28,23,"-""A Visit to Kosovo,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in November 2003 </SPAN></P><P>This month I have penned a few words about my short visit to Pristina, Kosovo 7-9 May 2003. I flew inexpensively from Cairo to Pristina on Turkish Airlines via Istanbul. Nothing can really compensate for the 8-hour layover in Istanbul on the northbound trip after not having slept the previous night unless perhaps one uses those hours in downtown Istanbul en route. But at least the experience is made all the more pleasant by Istanbul's wonderful new airport terminal.<BR><BR>The rich agricultural lands near Pristina have been tilled continuously for some 6,000 years. The Roman town of Ulpiana was built there upon an earlier settlement. This was later fortified by Justinian in 518. The present name of the city has evolved from ""Justiniana"" to ""Istriana"" to Pri + Istrina,"" today pronounced ""Prish-tee'-na."" <BR><BR>With a population of some 600,000 in 1999, Pristina occupies a central point on the Kosovo plain. Pristina is surrounded by low hills, and from the outskirts of town one can see snow-covered mountains in the distance. Pristina contains a central core with some Ottoman buildings. There are mosques built in the Turkish architectural tradition and a nineteenth century Ottoman clock tower. Unfortunately the small collection of the Pristina Museum happened to be closed during the week of my visit. The museum is said to contain only a few objects now as the large archeological collection was looted by Serbian troops in 1999.<BR><BR>In that same year the central post office and police headquarters were both destroyed by NATO cruise missiles, probably fired from ships in the Adriatic. A high rise building which contained the various Kosovo ministries was also devastated by the shock wave emanating from the nearby missile strike on the central post office. Four years later, the rubble in that high rise was being stripped out by a European Union aid project so that the building could be reconstructed and re-used eventually. <BR><BR>Today Kosovo is administered by the United Nations. The acronyms UNMIK (United Nations Mission in Kosovo) and KFOR (United Nations Kosovo Forces) are to be seen on buildings and vehicles all over Pristina. Specifically, the United Nations is responsible for provision of assistance to Kosovo in the fields of police and justice and also in civil administration. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) provides assistance in transitional planning. The European Union is charged with providing assistance to Kosovo in economic reconstruction.<BR><BR>In Pristina I was the guest of a friend who works in the reconstruction of public utilities. As one might expect, there is some frustration felt between the various power spheres involved in development in Kosovo. Such frustrations probably largely escape the public eye. <BR><BR>In May 2003 my friend commented to me that the joke in the development community in Kosovo was that only if the United States really wanted to hurt Iraq would the U. S. allow the United Nations to become involved in reconstruction there. Contrary to world opinion, expatriates involved in the Kosovo aid effort feel that in general the United Nations is too bureaucratic and unfocused. In addition, too often the U. N. lacks an exit strategy. <BR><BR>Prior to the recent conflict, Kosovo constituted an autonomous region of Yugoslavia. Currently administrated by the United Nations, Kosovo is not a country as such. This is important for such development issues as privatization which is all the rage nowadays, especially in Eastern Europe</SPAN>. If Kosovo is not a country, what will guarantee the rights of potential investors? Who would want to risk investing his capital in Kosovo if it is not a country?<BR><BR>On another level, on the street in Pristina one can buy current popular music CDs for only 1.50 euros each and the latest computer software such as Windows XP, Encarta 2003, Photoshop 7.0 and McAfee Anti-virus 2003 for only 2.50 euros each. The men selling these CDs explain that these programs are imported from </SPAN>Russia, Bulgaria and Greece. One's initial reaction is that this is theft of intellectual property. However, it may be the case that at the moment there is no law on the books which prohibits such activity. After all, Kosovo's laws are still in the process of codification. <BR><BR>During my short visit to Pristina I also took an interesting excursion to the nearby town of Gracanica where there is a church built in 1321 by King Milutin of Serbia. Originally there was a monastery too, but today only the church remains. The church contains a series of frescoes which is said to be a masterpiece of medieval art. Grananica is only a 15-minute drive from downtown Pristina, and a taxi will take a tourist there and back for as little as 15 euros.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR><A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com</A><BR> </SPAN><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P></SPAN>",285
29,23,"""A Yangtze River Cruise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in May 2004</FONT> <P>China's Yangtze River is the world's third longest river after the Nile and the Amazon. With a total length of 3,434 miles (5,526 km), the Yangtze rises in the highlands of Tibet and runs the width of China, flowing into the East China Sea near Shanghai. The Yangtze River Valley is famous for its landscapes which include spectacular gorges and steep mountains.</FONT></P><P >Traditionally Yangtze River cruise passengers were able to observe scenes of rural village life along the river's narrow cliff-lined course as well as some of China's cultural and natural treasures. While the recent construction of the 1.5-mile-long (2.395-kilometer-long) Three Gorges Dam has meant that many villages along the Yangtze are currently in the process of being inundated, travelers will still find it interesting to view the riverside inhabitants' transition to new housing. Too, the rising waters have actually served to ease navigation through the narrowest of the Yangtze River gorges; and the most important cultural relics and antiquities are being moved or otherwise protected.</P><P >Construction of the Three Gorges Dam, China's largest construction project since the building of the Great Wall, began at Sandouping along the Yangtze River in December 1993. Closure of two-thirds of the river was achieved in November 1997. Then in June 2003 total river closure was finally completed, so the reservoir finally began to fill and electricity generation also commenced.</P><P >The world's largest hydroelectric power plant with twenty-six 700-megawatt (MW) turbines, the Three Gorges Dam will have a total electrical generating capacity of 18,200 MW, equivalent to that of 18 nuclear reactors. The output of the Three Gorges Dam will be 44% greater than the output of Brazil's Itaipu Dam, which contains eighteen 700-MW turbines. Itaipu is the world's second largest dam. When it is completed in 2009, the Three Gorges Dam is slated to provide 84.8 billion kilowatt hours per year, or nearly 10% of China's energy requirements.</P><P >Additional reasons for dam construction include navigation, irrigation and flood control. Historically the Yangtze has flooded about once every decade, and more than a million people died in these devastating floods in the twentieth century alone.</P><P >The magnitude of the USD 30 billion Three Gorges Dam project is overwhelming. When completed, this dam will have required double the concrete used to construct Brazil's Itaipu Dam. It will also create a 5,000,000,000,000-gallon (18,927,000,000,000-liter) reservoir some 385 miles (620 km) long. The total rise in water level behind the dam will be 361 feet (110 meters) by 2009. This new lake will displace some 1.5 million people. While it lies near a fault zone, the Chinese claim that the Three Gorges Dam is being built to withstand an earthquake of 7.0 magnitude on the Richter Scale.</P><P >Yangtze River cruises operate between Chongqing (Chungking) in the west and either Yichang or Wuhan in the east.</P><P >During World War II Chongqing served as the capital of China. Then Chongqing also played host to the American volunteer air corps known as the Flying Tigers. Today the port city of Chongqing is China&'s largest inland metropolis and the most important industrial city in southwestern China. Chongqing is 1,490 miles (2,398 kilometers) upstream from Shanghai and 660 miles (1,062 kilometers) from Beijing.</P><P >East of Chongqing near Fengdu is the Snow Jade Cave formed from karst, a limestone which is easily eroded. Created 50,000 years ago but only recently discovered by local farmers, the cave was opened to the public in late 2003. The Snow Jade Cave has a total length of one mile (1.6 kilometers).</P><P >Further downstream near Zhongxian is the Shibaozhai (""Precious Stone Fortress"") Temple. This 12-story architectural gem dating back to the eighteenth century was originally built atop a 721-foot (220-meter) cliff. A wooden pavilion with stair access was added in 1819 and a further three stories were completed in 1956. When the filling of the reservoir has been completed in 2009 this temple will be preserved on a small island of its own by a coffer dam.</P><P >For most travelers the highlights of a Yangtze River cruise are the famed three gorges which are situated in a 118-mile (189-kilometer) stretch between Chongqing and Yichang. The 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) Qutang Gorge, the shortest and narrowest of the three, is known for the mists which swirl around its limestone peaks. Prior to the recent rise of the waters, the 25-mile-long (40-kilometer-long) Qutang Gorge, hemmed in by high cliffs, was no more than 500 feet (152 meters) wide. The Wu Gorge, sometimes said to be the most beautiful, also offers scenes of green mist-shrouded mountains. So sheer are the cliffs that legend has it that the sun never penetrates. The 47-mile-long (75-kilometer-long) Xi Ling Gorge, longest and historically the most dangerous of the three, is noted for its caves and rock formations. This latter gorge is bisected by the Three Gorges Dam.</P><P >Aside from the three gorges on the Yangtze River itself, there are also three breathtaking lesser gorges on the Daning River, a Yangtze tributary. A day trip up the Daning in a sampan is perhaps the most romantic and beautiful of any of the excursions offered during a Yangtze River cruise. Steep mountains rise on both sides of the clear Daning River, and the gorges are separated by lush terraced fields. Two ancient hanging coffins may also be seen there high up on the cliffs.</P><P >Yangtze River cruises must now transit the Three Gorges Dam, which contains the world's largest ship locks. The double five-stage locks are each 256 yards (280 meters) long, 31 yards (34 meters) wide and 4.6 yards (5 meters) deep. Many boats can fit easily into each lock concurrently. After transiting the locks the river boats stop and a very interesting tour is given of the Three Gorges Dam project.</P><P >Some Yangtze River cruises end at Yichang. However, mine continued downstream for two additional days along the Yangtze plain. In Jingzhou (Jiangling) a very touching tour was organized to a primary school. Jingzhou was the capital of China some 2,500 years ago, and remains of the old city wall can still be seen today.</P><P >My cruise concluded in the metropolis of Wuhan, a major industrial center and transportation hub. Wuhan is roughly midway between Beijing in the north and Guangzhou (Canton) in the south. It is also midway between Chongqing in the west and Shanghai in the east.</P><P >In Wuhan I toured the Hubei Provincial Museum. Most of the museum's contents were unearthed in a single tomb in 1978. The tomb, dating to 433 B. C., contained the world's heaviest musical instrument, which is on display in the museum. Weighing 5,525 pounds (2,506 kilograms), that set of 65 bells covers 5 1/2 octaves.</P><P >Inevitably some aspects of a Yangtze River cruise experience have been altered by the Three Gorges Dam. But the gorges themselves with their impressive landscapes remain natural wonders which will continue to draw cruise visitors long after the dam's completion in 2009.</P><P >The absolute best time for a Yangtse River cruise is in the early spring. Heat, humidity and rainfall conspire to make travel less pleasant during the period from May through October. And fog can sometimes frustrate photographers from October through March.</P><P >Flying time from Cairo to Beijing is upwards of 19 hours. Singapore Airlines, for instance, provides an excellent and comfortable air service via Dubai and Singapore. Round trip basic airfares begin from EGP 4,264 plus taxes. Since the cheapest air seats are always limited, it is advisable to reserve early. Here in Egypt air reservations on most airlines may be booked up to 11 months in advance. Also, a tourist visa is required in order to visit China; and China tourist visa issuance in Cairo normally requires a minimum of one week.</P><P >First-time visitors to China should give consideration to combining a Yangtze River cruise with a visit to Beijing, Xian and/or Shanghai. Beijing offers world-class sightseeing in the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and Tiananmen Square. Xian's incredible 7,000 terra cotta warriors are now world famous. Shanghai, China's largest city and the world's third largest container port, has long been open to Western influences. In particular, it is interesting to view the various architectural styles - Renaissance, Gothic and art nouveau - along the Bund, Shanghai's elegant corniche.</P><P >If you've enjoyed cruises on the Nile and on Lake Nasser in the past, why not try a Yangtze River cruise next?</P><P ><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 January 2008<BR><A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT></A><BR> </SPAN><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P></SPAN>",632
30,23,"""Viewing HMS Bounty</EM> Artifacts on a Day Trip from London to Greenwich, England,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2005<BR> </SPAN> <BR>Maritime buffs can enjoy an interesting day trip from London to the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site, which offers a number of attractions. Greenwich, literally the ""green village,"" contains crooked lanes, bric-a-brac shops and bustling antique and flea markets. HMAS (Her Majesty's Armed Ship) <I>Bounty</I> and Pitcairn Island enthusiasts will be drawn in particular to the National Maritime Museum (NMM) and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG).<BR><BR>The NMM (http:\\www.nmm.ac.uk) is a state-of-the-art facility with fascinating displays on Britain's maritime past, present and future. Founded in 1934, this is the world's largest nautical museum, with a collection of over two million items. Its 20 galleries display some of the finest objects, covering many aspects of ships, seafaring and marine affairs. The museum is housed in historic buildings which were formerly a school for the sons of seamen.<BR><BR>A number of artifacts from the <I>Bounty</I> are showcased in the Trade and Empire gallery, including a coconut shell, a horn cup and a small weight used to measure out portions of food. Presumably these instruments were used by William Bligh and his loyalists on their lengthy longboat voyage. A worm-eaten piece of wood from the <I>Bounty</I>'s rudder is displayed as are a corkscrew and a pipe said to have belonged to Bligh. A braided grey lock of mutineer John Adams' hair several inches long is also exhibited. Adjacent to that is John Adams' original grave marker from Pitcairn Island. John Adams was the last of the mutineers to die on Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific.<BR><BR>Although one of the museum's most fascinating <I>Bounty</I>-related items is not on display, it can be viewed easily upon application to the NMM's Caird Library. This library contains a copy of ""The Log of HMS Bounty 1787-1789"" by William Bligh. The volume in the museum is number 236 of a limited edition of 500 copies published in 1975 by Genesis Publications of Surrey, England. The book is a photographic reproduction of the original handwritten document which is held at the Public Records Office in Kew, England. Upon opening the <I>Bounty</I> log to page 248, visitors can read Bligh's own longhand account of the events of the mutiny on 28 April 1989. <BR><BR>Just across the park and up a small hill is the ROG (http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/navId/005000002002),<BR>which was founded in 1675 by King Charles II and designed by Sir Christopher Wren. The original purpose of the ROG was to provide accurate charts of the stars in order to improve navigation. Today this institution is the home of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees). <BR><BR>GMT, of course, is the basis of standard time throughout the world. The Shepherd gate clock at the ROG, installed in 1852 and still functioning, was the first public clock to display GMT. The ROG's red rooftop ball has dropped daily at precisely 1 p.m. since 1833. This used to assist mariners on the Thames to set their chronometers. <BR><BR>The prime meridian is the zero point which has been used in the calculation of terrestrial longitudes since 1884. Visitors may have their photographs taken at the meridian line while straddling two hemispheres. <BR><BR>On exhibit at the ROG are the four well-known marine timekeepers completed by John Harrison between 1735 and 1759. In addition, Larcum Kendall's second timekeeper is on display. This chronometer, known as K2, was built in 1771. A simplified and cheaper version of Harrison's H4 timekeeper, which itself dates to 1759, K2 was used by Captain Phipps on his Arctic voyage of discovery in 1773 and was later issued to William Bligh for use on the <I>Bounty</I>. <BR><BR>The Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site also includes some other places of general interest. The seventeenth-century Palladian Queen's House was England's first purely classical building. Designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 as a retreat for Anne of Denmark, queen to James I, the building was refurbished in 2001 and now provides well-lit galleries. The Queen's House contains the Tulip Stairs which date to 1635. This was Britain's first centrally unsupported spiral stairway.<BR><BR>The outstanding painted hall and chapel of the nearby Old Royal Naval College, originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1695 to house naval pensioners, are also open to the public. The buildings, which became the Royal Naval College in 1873, are said to be a Baroque masterpiece. <BR><BR>The hauntingly beautiful and much-visited <I>Cutty Sark</I>, launched in 1869 and the last of the China tea clipper ships, has been in dry dock at Greenwich Pier since 1954. Nearby, also in dry dock is <I>Gipsy Moth</I> IV, in which Sir Francis Chichester circumnavigated the world in 119 days in 1967. <BR><BR>Those who collect maritime history books will appreciate the existence of a nautical bookstore in Greenwich. Those not tempted by nautical books may enjoy browsing instead in one of Greenwich's four interesting bargain bookstores where every title is marked down to only Sterling 2.00. <BR><BR>Greenwich can be reached easily by riverboat in about an hour from Embankment Pier, Tower Millennium Pier, Waterloo Millennium Pier or Westminster Millennium Pier, all in central London. This has been called the best boat ride in London. Even Henry VIII arrived in Greenwich by boat on one of his hunting expeditions. Today visitors ride by the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the recently-developed Docklands area. Three miles downstream the Thames erupts into one of the most sublime sights of English architecture. Minutes later the masts and rigging of the <I>Cutty Sark</I> finally come into view. <BR><BR>And yet a day trip from London to Greenwich can be quite inexpensive. A round trip boat ticket is about Sterling 6.00 ($10.25). Or, for only Sterling 4.10 ($7.00), visitors to London may purchase a Day Travelcard valid for unlimited travel on the underground, buses and the modern Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in zones one and two. This pass may be purchased at certain main underground stations only after 9:30 a.m., and it is valid until 4:30 a.m. the following day. <BR><BR>More expensive versions of the Day Travelcard exist for those requiring travel in additional zones and/or travel on multiple days. The Travelcard is also sold at Heathrow Airport's tube stations after 9:30 a.m. Incidentally, holders of a Travelcard are entitled to one-third off the price of most riverboat services.<BR><BR>Visitors will find it convenient to change from the Jubilee Line of the underground to the DLR at Canary Wharf where only a short walk is required. It is best to alight from the DLR at the ""<I>Cutty Sark</I> for Maritime Greenwich"" station. Signs are posted to the various attractions in Greenwich. Admission is free to both the NMM and the ROG. Restaurants and sandwich shops in the compact area of maritime Greenwich enable visitors to spend an entire day there, including a lovely indoor lunch or a picnic outdoors in the park or near the pier. <BR><BR><BR><B>AUTHOR'S NOTE:<BR></B><BR>For nearly 40 years I have been fascinated by the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and by Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific where the mutineers fled. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read the Nordhoff and Hall <I>Bounty</I> Trilogy and then began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. Recently I realized that it would be very easy for me to view some of the original artifacts relating to the <I>Bounty</I> saga. After visiting Greenwich, England in July 2003 I wrote the short article above. <BR><BR>I realize that most other people will not have the same level of interest as I have in the <I>Bounty</I> and in Pitcairn Island. Nevertheless I hope that this article may stimulate others to realize that, similarly, it might not be so difficult for them to visit locations or museums which may hold original artifacts relating to a topic which may be of interest to them. <P><BR>Ted Cookson<BR> Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR> 5 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P>",260
31,23,"A ""MOST TRAVELED PEOPLE"" VISIT TO WAKE ISLAND<br>by Ted Cookson<br><br>Dan Walker quickly descended from the gleaming white Continental Airlines 737-800 in the light rain. After reaching the freshly-laid blacktop on the runway, he turned to the right, walked a short distance, and asked a friend to snap his photo in front of the beige airport terminal building. At 8:39 AM on December 11, 2009 the lanky, six-foot six-inch Walker had become one of a relatively small number of tourists in recent decades to visit Wake Island.  <br><br>When he is not traveling around the world, Walker, a Canadian living in Costa Rica, heads the Casa Canada Group, an umbrella organization for various companies dealing in investment, company and asset management, and travel as well as the non-profit Association of Residents of Costa Rica.  <br> <br>By participating in this tour operated by Military Historical Tours of Woodbridge, Virginia, the grinning Walker had also become one of only 82 members of Most Traveled People.com (MTP), a free online travel club, to reach Wake Island.  Followed by its well over 7,000 members, the club's list, available at www.mosttraveledpeople.com, currently contains 773 destinations worldwide. <br><br>What made this tour to Wake Island special was that 24 MTP members living in ten countries participated.  Of the top 21 MTP members (at the time of writing there was a tie for number 20), 12 were among the 97 paying passengers on the tour; and 17 of the top 40 MTP members were also there. Some remarked that this might have been the greatest concentration of well-traveled people ever assembled. <br><br>Most MTP participants had signed up many months in advance for this seldom-offered one-day Wake Island tour, which was priced at US$1,295 including round trip air from Guam, another American possession situated 2,417 km (1,502 miles) southwest of Wake and 2,507 km (1,558 miles) southeast of Tokyo. In fact, some persistent and patient travelers had even carried over deposits they had made for a longer tour in 2006 which was to have included Wake but which had to be cancelled after powerful Typhoon Ioke devastated Wake Island's air traffic control system in late August of that year. <br><br>Lying one-third of the distance from Guam to Hawaii, Wake has been in U. S. hands since it was taken from Spain in 1898 in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War. President Roosevelt awarded jurisdiction of the atoll to the U. S. Navy in 1934. Shortly thereafter, in 1935, Pan Am established a seaplane refueling station on Wake in order to enable the airline to begin operating its fabled twice-weekly trans-Pacific Clipper flights. The Clippers were amphibious Sikorsky, Boeing, and Martin aircraft that would depart Alameda or San Francisco, California for a 6-day, 60-hour trip to Manila via Hawaii, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam.<br><br>Construction of a naval base on Wake had been underway for eleven months when the Japanese invasion took place on 11 December 1941; and Japanese forces then occupied the atoll for the remainder of the war. The atoll was designated a U. S. national historic landmark in 1985. Today Wake Island is administered by the U. S. Air Force from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. Generally there are round trip flights from Honolulu to Wake twice a month. In addition, a supply barge is towed to the island as required. <br><br>Our tour of the island included visits to Invasion Beach, the Japanese-built revetments where enemy aircraft were kept, Drifter's Reef which is the current island watering hole, and the airport terminal building containing a U. S. post office, a one-room museum, and a well-stocked gift shop. Four memorials, a chapel and several old bunkers are all situated within a short walk of the terminal building. <br><br>Technical Sergeant Tom Czerwinski was one of a dozen or so support staff from the U. S. Air Force and Continental Airlines who accompanied our Military Historical Tours group from Guam. In preparation for our tour, Czerwinski had ridden one of the supply flights over to Wake round trip from Hickam Air Force Base. During the aircraft's two-hour turnaround, he had taken a quick tour of the island himself to ascertain which sites would be of most interest to a group of about 100 tourists. An Air Force medical specialist and a public affairs official also accompanied the group on the day of our visit. <br><br>Our local escort, who joined us for the tour in a yellow U. S. school bus and who hailed from Salem, Oregon, had been employed on Wake for a decade as an environmental specialist. Normally his work involved such things as performing bird counts and conserving natural artifacts. Our escort advised that certain areas around the island which are the responsibility of the U. S. Missile Defense Agency are designated as off limits. However, when questioned, he was unable to confirm whether missiles are in fact positioned on Wake at present. <br><br>The tour's finale was a wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate the sixty-eighth anniversary of the Japanese invasion of Wake Island. In addition to the large MTP contingent, 42 relatives and descendants of war veterans were in our group. Only two individuals who had fought against the Japanese on Wake participated in the tour. Since Military Historical Tours only operates groups to Wake at irregular intervals every few years, ours might have been the final tour to include those who had seen action on Wake. <br><br>At the conclusion of the ceremony all tour participants were wanded and our handbags were searched as we re-entered the airport terminal. After a flyover of Wake at dusk, Continental Captain Tom Campanelli smoothly pointed our aircraft toward the blazing sunset in the southwest for the three hour and seven minute flight back to Guam. <br><br>It had been a unique day.<br><br> <br><br>Ted Cookson<br>Manager - Maadi<br>Egypt Panorama Tours<br>Cairo, Egypt<br>26 December 2009<br>www.eptours.com <br>www.tedcookson.com ",79
32,23,"""A Yangtze River Cruise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in May 2004</FONT> </P><P>China's Yangtze River is the world's third longest river after the Nile and the Amazon. With a total length of 3,434 miles (5,526 km), the Yangtze rises in the highlands of Tibet and runs the width of China, flowing into the East China Sea near Shanghai. The Yangtze River Valley is famous for its landscapes which include spectacular gorges and steep mountains.</FONT></P><P >Traditionally Yangtze River cruise passengers were able to observe scenes of rural village life along the river's narrow cliff-lined course as well as some of China's cultural and natural treasures. While the recent construction of the 1.5-mile-long (2,395-kilometer-long) Three Gorges Dam has meant that many villages along the Yangtze are currently in the process of being inundated, travelers will still find it interesting to view the riverside inhabitants' transition to new housing. Too, the rising waters have actually served to ease navigation through the narrowest of the Yangtze River gorges; and the most important cultural relics and antiquities are being moved or otherwise protected.</P><P >Construction of the Three Gorges Dam, China's largest construction project since the building of the Great Wall, began at Sandouping along the Yangtze River in December 1993. Closure of two-thirds of the river was achieved in November 1997. Then in June 2003 total river closure was finally completed, so the reservoir finally began to fill and electricity generation also commenced.</P><P >The world's largest hydroelectric power plant with twenty-six 700-megawatt (MW) turbines, the Three Gorges Dam will have a total electrical generating capacity of 18,200 MW, equivalent to that of 18 nuclear reactors. The output of the Three Gorges Dam will be 44% greater than the output of Brazil's Itaipu Dam, which contains eighteen 700-MW turbines. Itaipu is the world's second largest dam. When it is completed in 2009, the Three Gorges Dam is slated to provide 84.8 billion kilowatt hours per year, or nearly 10% of China's energy requirements.</P><P >Additional reasons for dam construction include navigation, irrigation and flood control. Historically the Yangtze has flooded about once every decade, and more than a million people died in these devastating floods in the twentieth century alone.</P><P >The magnitude of the USD 30 billion Three Gorges Dam project is overwhelming. When completed, this dam will have required double the concrete used to construct Brazil's Itaipu Dam. It will also create a 5,000,000,000,000-gallon (18,927,000,000,000-liter) reservoir some 385 miles (620 km) long. The total rise in water level behind the dam will be 361 feet (110 meters) by 2009. This new lake will displace some 1.5 million people. While it lies near a fault zone, the Chinese claim that the Three Gorges Dam is being built to withstand an earthquake of 7.0 magnitude on the Richter Scale.</P><P >Yangtze River cruises operate between Chongqing (Chungking) in the west and either Yichang or Wuhan in the east.</P><P >During World War II Chongqing served as the capital of China. Then Chongqing also played host to the American volunteer air corps known as the Flying Tigers. Today the port city of Chongqing is China's largest inland metropolis and the most important industrial city in southwestern China. Chongqing is 1,490 miles (2,398 kilometers) upstream from Shanghai and 660 miles (1,062 kilometers) from Beijing.</P><P >East of Chongqing near Fengdu is the Snow Jade Cave formed from karst, a limestone which is easily eroded. Created 50,000 years ago but only recently discovered by local farmers, the cave was opened to the public in late 2003. The Snow Jade Cave has a total length of one mile (1.6 kilometers).</P><P >Further downstream near Zhongxian is the Shibaozhai (""Precious Stone Fortress"") Temple. This 12-story architectural gem dating back to the eighteenth century was originally built atop a 721-foot (220-meter) cliff. A wooden pavilion with stair access was added in 1819 and a further three stories were completed in 1956. When the filling of the reservoir has been completed in 2009 this temple will be preserved on a small island of its own by a coffer dam.</P><P >For most travelers the highlights of a Yangtze River cruise are the famed three gorges which are situated in a 118-mile (189-kilometer) stretch between Chongqing and Yichang. The 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) Qutang Gorge, the shortest and narrowest of the three, is known for the mists which swirl around its limestone peaks. Prior to the recent rise of the waters, the 25-mile-long (40-kilometer-long) Qutang Gorge, hemmed in by high cliffs, was no more than 500 feet (152 meters) wide. The Wu Gorge, sometimes said to be the most beautiful, also offers scenes of green mist-shrouded mountains. So sheer are the cliffs that legend has it that the sun never penetrates. The 47-mile-long (75-kilometer-long) Xi Ling Gorge, longest and historically the most dangerous of the three, is noted for its caves and rock formations. This latter gorge is bisected by the Three Gorges Dam.</P><P >Aside from the three gorges on the Yangtze River itself, there are also three breathtaking lesser gorges on the Daning River, a Yangtze tributary. A day trip up the Daning in a sampan is perhaps the most romantic and beautiful of any of the excursions offered during a Yangtze River cruise. Steep mountains rise on both sides of the clear Daning River, and the gorges are separated by lush terraced fields. Two ancient hanging coffins may also be seen there high up on the cliffs.</P><P >Yangtze River cruises must now transit the Three Gorges Dam, which contains the world's largest ship locks. The double five-stage locks are each 256 yards (280 meters) long, 31 yards (34 meters) wide and 4.6 yards (5 meters) deep. Many boats can fit easily into each lock concurrently. After transiting the locks the river boats stop and a very interesting tour is given of the Three Gorges Dam project.</P><P >Some Yangtze River cruises end at Yichang. However, mine continued downstream for two additional days along the Yangtze plain. In Jingzhou (Jiangling) a very touching tour was organized to a primary school. Jingzhou was the capital of China some 2,500 years ago, and remains of the old city wall can still be seen today.</P><P >My cruise concluded in the metropolis of Wuhan, a major industrial center and transportation hub. Wuhan is roughly midway between Beijing in the north and Guangzhou (Canton) in the south. It is also midway between Chongqing in the west and Shanghai in the east.</P><P >In Wuhan I toured the Hubei Provincial Museum. Most of the museum's contents were unearthed in a single tomb in 1978. The tomb, dating to 433 B. C., contained the world's heaviest musical instrument, which is on display in the museum. Weighing 5,525 pounds (2,506 kilograms), that set of 65 bells covers 5 1/2 octaves.</P><P >Inevitably some aspects of a Yangtze River cruise experience have been altered by the Three Gorges Dam. But the gorges themselves with their impressive landscapes remain natural wonders which will continue to draw cruise visitors long after the dam's completion in 2009.</P><P >The absolute best time for a Yangtse River cruise is in the early spring. Heat, humidity and rainfall conspire to make travel less pleasant during the period from May through October. And fog can sometimes frustrate photographers from October through March.</P><P >Flying time from Cairo to Beijing is upwards of 19 hours. Singapore Airlines, for instance, provides an excellent and comfortable air service via Dubai and Singapore. Round trip basic airfares begin from EGP 4,264 plus taxes. Since the cheapest air seats are always limited, it is advisable to reserve early. Here in Egypt air reservations on most airlines may be booked up to 11 months in advance. Also, a tourist visa is required in order to visit China; and China tourist visa issuance in Cairo normally requires a minimum of one week.</P><P >First-time visitors to China should give consideration to combining a Yangtze River cruise with a visit to Beijing, Xian and/or Shanghai. Beijing offers world-class sightseeing in the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and Tian'anmen Square. Xian's incredible 7,000 terra cotta warriors are now world famous. Shanghai, China's largest city and the world's third largest container port, has long been open to Western influences. In particular, it is interesting to view the various architectural styles - Renaissance, Gothic and art nouveau - along the Bund, Shanghai's elegant corniche.</P><P >If you've enjoyed cruises on the Nile and on Lake Nasser in the past, why not try a Yangtze River cruise next?</P><P ><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 January 2008<BR><A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT></A><BR> </SPAN><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P></SPAN>",642
33,23,"""Jordan,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2005 <br><br>While Jordan is a country for all seasons, it is most often visited during spring and fall, between the temperature extremes of winter and summer.  The best weather is in April and October, while winter snows are not unknown in Jordan.<br><br>Amman, the capital, boasts a Roman amphitheater and a museum.  The so-called Kings' Highway, a well-paved but winding road, makes for an interesting full-day drive between Amman and Petra, Jordan's primary tourist attraction.  Heading south, Madaba is the first stop.  A church there contains the oldest known map of Palestine, which is depicted in mosaic on the floor.  Farther along, the Biblical site of Mt. Nebo features lovely examples of mosaics in its small museum.  There is also a fabulous overlook of the Dead Sea, situated far below in the Wadi Araba.  The final tourist site on the Kings' Highway is Kerak, where there is a well-preserved Crusader-era castle.  Tourists then sleep at Petra and begin their sightseeing there the following morning. <br><br>Settled by the Nabataeans in about 500 B. C., rock-carved Petra was the capital of a mighty empire which at times stretched as far north as Damascus.  It is thought that the Nabataeans extracted transit fees from passing trade caravans.  Whatever the case, Petra grew rich as a trading metropolis, reaching its zenith around the time of Christ.  In 106 A. D. Trajan incorporated the Nabataean kingdom into the Roman empire as the province of Arabia Petraea.  Petra's decline began in the third century, and then it was forgotten from the Middle Ages until being rediscovered by the Swiss adventurer Burckhardt in 1812.<br><br>The height of the siq, a gorge several miles long which forms the entrance to Petra, is as much as 300 meters.  Yet in some places it is only a few meters wide.  Many tourists elect to ride horses or horse carriages through the siq while others walk.  At the end of the siq, visitors suddenly come upon the remarkable pink sandstone facade of the so-called Treasury, probably dedicated to one of the Nabataean kings.  The theatre and a great number of tombs carved from the pink rock are to be seen farther down the widening gorge.  The trail continues into the former town center, which contains the remains of a triumphal arch, a palace, temples and various dwellings.<br><br>Had Petra never existed, the magnificent Roman-era ruins at Jerash, situated an hour north of Amman, would probably be more well-known than they are today.  As it is, Jerash is Jordan's second most important tourist site.  Founded in the fourth century B. C., Jerash's golden age began after the city was captured by Pompey in 63 B. C.  Much construction was undertaken in the first and second centuries A. D.  Jerash reached the height of its power during the third century A. D. after the fall of Palmyra, its rival to the north in present-day Syria.  Later Jerash was sacked by the Persians in 614 A. D. and again by the Arabs in 635 A. D.  The city boasted a 1900-meter-long main street, and many of the first- and second-century Ionic and Corinthian columns which formerly lined that street have been preserved.  An amphitheater and a forum also existed in addition to temples dedicated to Zeus and Artemis. <br><br>A long weekend in Jordan is a wonderful escape for those who enjoy viewing antiquities.  While pleasant, the beach hotels in Aqaba, Jordan's Red Sea port adjacent to Eilat, Israel, offer little to those living in Egypt who have access to Sinai's well-developed beach resorts.  On the other hand, one special highlight in Jordan is the Dead Sea where, in addition to enjoying traditional spa activities, tourists can experience the unique sensation of floating in the world's most buoyant water!  <br><br>Current round trip airfare from Cairo to Amman, including taxes, is approximately 2,160 Egyptian pounds on Royal Jordanian and approximately 2,200 Egyptian pounds on Egypt Air, with no minimum stay.  Egypt Air flies once daily between the two capitals, and Royal Jordanian flies either once or twice daily.  Confusingly, the air schedules are not the same every day for either airline.  There is a cash departure tax of 5 Jordanian dinars (equivalent to about 41 Egyptian pounds) upon departure from Amman's Queen Alia International Airport.  As of 6 October 2009 USD 1.00 = 5.515 Egyptian pounds.<br><br>Ted Cookson<br>Manager - Maadi<br>Egypt Panorama Tours<br>Cairo, Egypt<br>6 October 2009<br>www.eptours.com<br>www.tedcookson.com<br>",431
34,23,"""Italy's Amalfi Coast,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2007 <BR><BR> </P><O:P><P >The Amalfi Coast on the southern part of the Sorrento Peninsula is one of the prettiest areas in Italy. The Amalfi Drive, hugging the coast of the Campania region along the Gulf of Salerno, has been called Italy's most romantic road. This narrow, winding cliff-hanging byway, in places carved right out of the side of the mountain, is a challenge to navigate. However, those traversing the Amalfi Drive are rewarded with spectacular views of small coves and of boats bobbing in the azure sea far below. Amalfi and Positano are the two most popular spots along the Amalfi Coast. </P><P >Amalfi, 61 km (38 miles) east of Sorrento and with a population of only 5,500, is the largest town on this coast. Dramatically situated at the mouth of a ravine under towering 1,315-meter (4,312-foot) Mt. Cerreto, the burg is sandwiched between tall cliffs and a rocky coastline broken occasionally by coves with sandy beaches. </P><P >Amalfi's rich history is not evident from what tourists see today. Incredibly, this small town was once the capital of the seafaring Republic of Amalfi, one of the great maritime powers. From the ninth to the eleventh century Amalfi rivaled Venice and Genoa for influence in the Mediterranean. </P><P >The first mention of Amalfi dates from the sixth century, and a circular maritime trade with the East developed soon thereafter. Grain, slaves, salt and timber were traded to Egypt and Syria for gold dinars. These coins were then paid to the Byzantines for silk which was in turn sold back in Europe. Independent from the seventh century until 1075, Amalfi reached the height of its power in about 1000 when it boasted a population of 70,000. Not only was the ship compass introduced to Europe in 1302 by Flavio Gioia, an Amalfi native, but Amalfi's maritime code was used in the Mediterranean until 1570. </P><P >Positano, a picturesque seaport of 3,900 lying 17 km (11 miles) west of Amalfi, was part of the maritime Republic of Amalfi in the tenth century. However, Positano's apogee came much later. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ships from Positano carried silk, spices and wood to the Middle East. The subsequent decline of Positano's prosperity coincided with the rise of steamships in the mid-nineteenth century. As much as three-quarters of the town's population of 8,000 immigrated to the United States, with the majority going to New York. Interestingly, one of the tough tasks that faced later mayors of Positano was finding enough burial plots for those very emigrees, many of whom wanted to be buried back in their birthplace. </P><P >Positano, little more than a sleepy fishing village in the early twentieth century, was discovered after World War II when American troops, stationed in nearby Salerno, began taking holidays there. In the 1950s writers such as John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams and painters such as Paul Klee were drawn to Positano. In the 1960s Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones composed the lyrics to their song Midnight Rambler while on holiday in Positano. The rest, as they say, is history. Today tourism is the major industry, and the town is simply besieged by Europeans and North Americans during the summer. Positano is now among Europe's most chic destinations. </P><P >Sorrento, on the Gulf of Naples, is the gateway to the Amalfi Coast. With a population of 17,000, Sorrento lies at the western end of the Amalfi Drive. It can be reached easily by train, bus, ferry or hydrofoil from Naples, only 50 km (30 miles) away, or by ferry or hydrofoil from the Isle of Capri. Local coastal ferries operate along the Amalfi Coast between Sorrento in the west and Salerno in the east. In summer there are also ferry and hydrofoil services between Amalfi, Positano and Capri and between Amalfi, Positano and Naples. </P></O:P></SPAN><O:P><P ><BR>Ted Cookson </P><P >Manager - Maadi </P><P >Egypt Panorama Tours </P><P >Cairo, Egypt<BR>1 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P><P > </P></O:P>",279
35,23,"""Fascinating Hong Kong,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in April 2006<BR> </SPAN> <BR>Hong Kong offers a bit of sightseeing and shopping within its 1,049 square km, and it is a perfect jumping-off point for China.<BR><BR>A ride up the Peak, whether by tram or by bus, is a must for every tourist. In good weather the view from the top is incredible. Hong Kong Harbor and several of the outlying islands are all clearly visible. The Peak itself is an exclusive residential suburb which boasts a number of mansions. There is also a scenic shopping mall there called Peak Tower. In order to withstand high winds, only one-third of this structure was built above ground. The Peak Tower is 400 meters above the harbor.<BR><BR>Below the Peak is Central, the crowded downtown district where many banks, office skyscrapers, and shops are located. On the back side of Hong Kong Island is Aberdeen, home to houseboats and floating restaurants. Farther on is the trendy beach at Repulse Bay and then Stanley Market where bargain hunters can haggle for deals. <BR><BR>Kowloon, on the mainland directly opposite Hong Kong Island, is also a bustling district. Kowloon's busiest area is known as Tsimshatsui. Here traffic is thick and the neon is always bright. Luxury cruise ships large and small dock at Kowloon's Ocean Terminal. Nearby is the Peninsula Hotel, one of the finest in the world. The Peninsula opened in the 1920s and today provides what is perhaps the most opulent accommodation in Hong Kong. Just a block away is the Star Ferry dock. The Star Ferry connects Kowloon with Hong Kong Island. Ferries depart every few minutes and the fare is nominal.<BR><BR>While Cantonese food predominates in Hong Kong, the choice of restaurants is tremendous. Similarly, there is much variety in terms of entertainment; and Chinese art and antiquities are seen in many shops. <BR><BR>While shopping is good in Hong Kong, the best prices are probably to be found at Shenzhen, located 35 km away in China proper, just across the Shenzhen River from Hong Kong. There a five-story shopping center bursts with many types of fashions and accessories and also a few electronics items. Shenzhen can be reached by rail in just 45 minutes from Kowloon. Then one simply walks across the border via covered bridge to the shipping center, which is not far from the immigration building. A Chinese tourist visa is required in order to cross this border.<BR><BR>Another popular day trip is to Macao, which was one of the first European settlements in East Asia. The hydrofoil from Hong Kong to Macao takes just 75 minutes, while the same trip by ferry can last up to three hours. The sixteenth- to eighteenth-century Portuguese architecture in Macao's baroque churches and old mansions is striking. The cobbled streets also serve to remind the visitor that he is experiencing a bit of southern Europe in China!<BR><BR><B>PRACTICALITIES: <BR></B><BR>The very best time to visit Hong Kong, Macao and China's southeastern provinces is during the period between mid-September and the end of December. During this season the weather is mild and it is dry. In October, November and December the humidity is less than in September. <BR><BR>The next best time to visit this region is March and April.

36,23,""" A Cruise to Greenland,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in August 2004<BR> <BR>Greenland is the largest island in the world. Although it has an area of 2.2 million square km, only 410,000 square km is not ice-covered. In fact, the Greenland ice sheet is the second largest in the world. The average ice thickness is 1,500 meters, and the ice sheet constitutes 10% of the world's fresh water. If Greenland's ice cap were to melt, sea level would rise by seven meters!<BR><BR>Greenland's first Stone Age inhabitants migrated from North America nearly 5,000 years ago. The Thule, who were closely related to the Inuit, arrived later in about 900 A. D., and Inuit migration continued until the late nineteenth century. Norse settlements were begun in 985 A. D. and lasted until the middle of the fifteenth century. European whalers visited Greenland from the sixteenth century onward, and a Norwegian priest settled there in 1721. Because the priest had received official Danish support for his expedition, his arrival ushered in a colonial era that lasted some two and a half centuries. A 1953 constitution granted Greenland home rule under Danish sovereignty. Essentially Greenland then became a province of Denmark. <BR><BR>Approximately 56,000 people live in Greenland. Of this total, some 49,000 were born there. Over 75% of the population lives in towns, of which Nuuk on Greenland's west coast is the largest. The central portion of western Greenland is the most densely populated. There 60% of the people swell in the six largest towns. The remainder live a rural existence in about 120 trading posts and sheep stations.<BR><BR>Sheep farming is practiced in the South. Fishing, however, is the major industry; and the cold-water prawn is the most important fishing product. Greenland halibut is also significant. Prawns constitute 64% of Greenland's exports. Halibut, crab and cod make up most of the remainder.<BR><BR>In August 2003 I sailed on Holland America Lines' MS Rotterdam from Rotterdam the New York City via Greenland. The Rotterdam sailed through beautiful Prins Christian Sund (Prince Christian Sound) and then called at the town of Qaqortoq on Greenland's southwest coast.<BR><BR>In southern Greenland there is a network of channels and fjords stretching 450 km. Prins Christian Sund, one of these channels, is navigable only from the middle of summer until late autumn. This remote area offers spectacular scenery. Glaciers, waterfalls, 1400-meter-high granite peaks and icebergs can all be seen. Prins Christian Sund is 58 km long and only 480 meters wide at its narrowest point. By comparison, the length of the Rotterdam is 237 meters.<BR><BR>Qaqortog, the largest town is southern Greenland with a population of 3,600, is situated in the area where Norsemen settled in the tenth century. Is is unclear why Norse settlement in Greenland failed by the fifteenth century. However, Norse ruins can still be seen today 15 km from town. Qaqortoq was founded in 1775 by a Norwegian trader. The town was originally named Junianehab after Danish Queen Juliana Marie. Julianehab became the largest trading post in southern Greenland, and it maintains that distinction today. The oldest standing house was built in 1797.<BR><BR>As is the case with all towns in Greenland, Qaqortoq has no road connections with any other city. Instead, the inhabitants of Qaqortoq use ferries and helicopters for public transportation. Because the harbor in Qaqortoq is small, the Rotterdam sat at anchor and passengers were taken ashore by the ship's tenders.<BR><BR>Qaqortoq is an academic center, with both a vocational school and a commercial college which, interestingly, offers a course in tourism. In addition, a nearby agricultural research station trains sheep farmers and operates an experimental farm.<BR><BR>It was interesting to walk in the center of Qaqortoq where several wooden and stone houses date back to the nineteenth century. A decade ago 18 Scandinavian sculptors created works of art on solid rock faces and on boulders lying around town. Today 24 sculptures exist. Too, Qaqortoq boasts Greenland's only fountain. Built in 1928, this sits in a town square. Finally, there is a small museum. <BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO GREENLAND:</P><P>Greenland can be reached by air from a number of cities, including: Baltimore, MD, USA; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Reykjavik, Iceland.

37,23,"""Greece's Corinth Canal,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in November 2007 </SPAN></P><P >On the afternoon of 24 May 2007 I was a passenger on the 208-passenger, 10,000-ton <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> when that vessel made a transit of the 3.9-mile (6.3-km)-long Corinth Canal from west to east. <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> is 439 feet (134 meters) long and 63 feet (19.2 meters) wide. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal connects the Gulf of Corinth with the Aegean Sea's Saronic Gulf. Cutting through the sandy alluvial soil of the Isthmus of Corinth, the canal separates the Peloponnesian peninsula from the Greek mainland. In effect, the canal creates an island out of the Peloponnesus. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal, only 68.9 feet (21 meters) wide and 26 feet (8 meters) deep, was constructed between 1881 and 1893. First the two ends were dug by a French firm. Then, after that company went bankrupt, a Greek contractor completed the work. The opening of the Corinth Canal a mere two dozen years after the opening of the Suez Canal helped to propel the Greek port of Piraeus into a major Mediterranean port. However, the expected windfall from canal tolls never materialized. In this age of supertankers, the Corinth Canal bears an anachronistic charm. <BR><BR>Because of the dangers faced by ancient mariners in their small boats, the idea of a canal across the narrow Ismthus of Corinth arose thousands of years ago. The first to attempt the construction of a canal was Periander, the seventh-century ruler of Corinth. Although Periander failed to dig much, he did improve upon the previous method of hauling small craft across the isthmus. That method involved pulling boats over large wooden rollers. Under Periander a stone trackway was built on which wheeled, flat vehicles could be used to pull boats. In fact, that system of portage remained in use until the twelfth century, and traces of the trackway can still be seen today near the canal's western end.<BR><BR>Roman Emperor Julius Caeser, who ruled from 48 to 44 B. C., also planned to build a canal across the Isthmus of Corinth. However, Caesar, of course, was assassinated. Later, in 54-68 A. D., the infamous Roman Emperor Nero actually participated in a ground-breaking ceremony for a canal using a golden pick, and six thousand Judean slaves began the excavation. But Nero, too, died shortly thereafter and the project was then abandoned until the late nineteenth century.<BR><BR>Small ships coming from the Western Mediterranean or from the Adriatic which are bound for the Eastern Mediterranean or the Black Sea find the Corinth Canal useful. Although ships narrow enough to utilize the canal can shave 248 miles (400 kilometers) off their journey, most of the 12,000 annual canal transits are now made for touristic purposes. Interestingly, the ships transiting the canal hail from more than 50 different countries.<BR> <BR>Two sightseeing options are available to those not able to sail on a cruise ship through the Corinth Canal.

38,23,"""A Day in Atlanta,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in July 2006 </P><P>My fiance Barbara and I had been talking about visiting Atlanta again ever since the new Georgia Aquarium opened to much hoopla in late November 2005. Finally, on 9 May 2007 while I was on holiday in the U. S., we were able to take advantage of a special airfare of only USD 109 per person to fly from Ft. Lauderdale to Atlanta round trip. </P><P >In Atlanta Barbara and I enjoyed an incredibly full day of sightseeing, returning home late the same night. In a day that began in Ft. Lauderdale before dawn, we were able to take tours of the spectacular Georgia Aquarium and the nearby CNN studios. In addition, before heading home we visited Atlanta's acclaimed High Museum of Fine Art and ate dinner at Mary Mac's Tea Room, an Atlanta institution for over 60 years. Future visitors to Atlanta will also be able to include a visit to the World of Coca-Cola which opened on a site adjacent to the Georgia Aquarium on 23 May 2007. </P><P >Upon arrival at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Barbara and I rented a car for the day. However, a cheaper option would have been to ride Atlanta's Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority (MARTA), which is convenient because it extends all the way out to the airport. MARTA is the ninth-largest rapid-transit system in the U. S.; and, interestingly, it is the largest U. S. rapid-transit agency which does not receive state operational funding. The Georgia Aquarium is only a 15-minute walk across Centennial Olympic Park from the CNN/Georgia World Congress Center MARTA stop.</P><P >Until the new three-story aquarium in the Dubai Mall opens in 2008, downtown Atlanta's Georgia Aquarium, with more than 100,000 marine animals of 500 different species living in over 30 million liters (8 million U. S. gallons) of water, is currently the largest aquarium in the world by far. In fact, the Georgia Aquarium is 60% larger than Chicago's Shedd Aquarium with its 19 million liters (5 million U. S. gallons) of water and 20,000 marine animals. </P><P >Although the Georgia Aquarium's adult admission is quite expensive at USD 24 per person, it is worth every penny. A gift to the people of Georgia from Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, who personally provided funding of USD 250 million for the project and then solicited additional corporate contributions to cover cost overruns caused by subsequent design upgrades, the aquarium welcomed its five millionth visitor on 23 May 2007. Among the most remarkable specimens may be the aquarium's four beluga whales and its three whale sharks, the only whale sharks maintained in an aquarium outside of Asia. </P><P >The aquatic animals are exhibited in five different and massive environments. ""Ocean Voyager"" includes whale sharks and nearly 100,000 fish in the museum's largest single tank, a 30-meter (100-foot) underwater tunnel, and the world's second-largest viewing window. ""Cold Water Quest"" highlights polar mammals and beluga whales, while California sea lions, African (""jackass"") penguins and Japanese spider crabs are also included in this exhibit. ""Tropical Diver"" features a display of live coral and other curious aquatic life forms. The child-oriented ""Georgia Explorer"" environment features touch tanks for sharks and rays and contains life forms from Gray's Reef, a national marine sanctuary off the coast of Georgia. Finally, ""River Scout"" boasts an overhead river where fish from North America can be viewed from underneath. Piranha and electric fish are also on display here. </P><P >In addition to being a major new attraction for Atlanta, the Georgia Aquarium is also tasked with important environmental and conservation missions, working to help save endangered species through programs of education and research. Atlanta's two male Beluga whales were rescued from a Mexico City amusement park, for instance. The Georgia Aquarium boasts three full-time veterinarians as well as a staff of university students from the nearby University of Georgia. The medical needs of the aquatic animals are handled from a USD 5 million on-site hospital, which is also used to conduct research. Special facilities such as these can be viewed only on one of the hour-long small group behind-the-scenes guided tours which the aquarium offers for USD 50 per person. </P><P >More information about the Georgia Aquarium can be found online at <A href=""http://www.georgiaaquarium.org"">http://www.georgiaaquarium.org</A>. Visitors to Atlanta should also note the existence of several joint tickets which allow entry to both the aquarium and another attraction such as Zoo Atlanta or Stone Mountain Park. These joint tickets are described in full at <A href=""http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/visitUs/specialoffers.aspx"">http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/visitUs/specialoffers.aspx</A>.</P><P >For expatriates and others living outside the U. S. who rely on CNN as a major daily news source, a tour of CNN's state-of-the-art studios at CNN Center in downtown Atlanta can be a fascinating experience. Visitors are able to view the various active studios from elevated glassed-in galleries but do not have direct access to the studio floors. The USD 12 one-hour tour highlights the history of the studios responsible for bringing 24/7 news to over a billion people around the world. Due to strong demand, tour tickets should be purchased online in advance at <A href=""http://edition.cnn.com/tour/atlanta/index.html"">http://edition.cnn.com/tour/atlanta/index.html</A>.</P><P >Founded in 1905 as the Atlanta Art Association, today the High Museum of Fine Art boasts a permanent collection in excess of 11,000 works of art. While the collection is strong in nineteenth- and twentieth-century American and European art, it also houses an interesting collection of African masks and sculptures. Special exhibitions at the museum are often the result of strong partnerships with the Louvre, the Brooklyn Museum, and other institutions. Information about the museum is available online at <A href=""http://www.high.org/"">http://www.high.org</A>. Adult admission is USD 15. </P><P >The World of Coca-Cola, which recently re-opened on a site adjacent to the Georgia Aquarium, features the world's largest Coke memorabilia collection, a functioning bottling line that produces commemorative 8-ounce bottles of Coca-Cola, a tasting experience for over 70 different Coke products, and a pop culture gallery featuring works of art by artists such as Andy Warhol. Details are available online at <A href=""http://www.woccatlanta.com/"">http://www.woccatlanta.com.</A> Adult admission is USD 14 online and USD 15 at the door. </P><P >Mary Mac's Tea Room was founded in 1945 by Mary McKinsey. Once but one out of a dozen and a half such tea rooms in ""intown"" Atlanta, today Mary Mac's Tea Room is the sole surviving tea room. Noted for its hospitality and reasonable prices, the restaurant, with its period decor, is said to feature Southern cooking almost identical to what was served over sixty years ago.

39,23,"""The Summit,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in March 2007 </P><P>Summiting this mountain had been one of my top goals for <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> last two years.

Totally inexperienced at mountain climbing, we wondered if we could physically summon up <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> strength and <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> stamina to climb such a world-class peak. <BR><BR>Several weeks of planning were necessary to help ensure <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> ultimate success of our mountaineering expedition 2-3 March 2007. Seats had to be reserved on a critical morning flight on 2 March, <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> day prior to our attempt on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN>. We also had to secure transportation from <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> airport to our base camp which, luckily, we were able to reach with no mishap early on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> evening of 2 March. All that maneuvering put us in place for our attempt on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN> early on 3 March. Yet we slept fitfully at base camp on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> night of 2 March. Although weather conditions appeared to be favorable, we both knew that anything could go wrong, especially at such an altitude. <BR><BR>After so much anticipation, we felt very relieved when we actually set foot on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN> late on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> morning of 3 March. After all, we had traveled a full 250 km (155 miles) from base camp that day.<BR><BR>We had taken a morning flight from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to Jacksonville, Florida. Our vehicle was an Avis rental car. Our base camp was a Holiday Inn in Florida's capital city of Tallahassee; and <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN> was that of Britton Hill, <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> highest point in Florida! <BR><BR>Britton Hill is situated in Lakewood Park, west of Paxton in Florida's Walton County. Part of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> string of rolling hills which runs along <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> northern edge of Florida's panhandle, this hill is only about 2 km (1 mile) from <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> Alabama border. In fact, Florida's Britton Hill, with an elevation of only 105 meters (345 feet) above sea level, claims <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> dubious distinction of being <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> lowest state high point in any of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> fifty U. S. states! <BR><BR>Varying in width from 48 km to 81 km (from 30 miles to 50 miles), <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> Florida Uplands extend some 444 km (275 miles) from west to east and then stretch south into <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> central Florida peninsula. This hilly region is characterized by its red clay soil and by both hardwood and softwood forests. <BR><BR>Lakewood Park, apparently named for <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> former postmistress of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> nearby village, is adjacent to a county road. It is only a short distance off US Highway 331, a major route between Montgomery, Alabama and Panama City, Florida, a beach resort on <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> Gulf of Mexico. Signs near Paxton, Florida, located just south of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> Alabama border, announce <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> existence of Lakewood Park. This Walton County park boasts not only picnic tables and restrooms but also a granite <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN> marker. <BR><BR>Historians say that in 1818 Andrew Jackson, before he became president, camped for several weeks on a nearby lake (now called Lake Jackson) while on a campaign to fight Indians in <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> region of Pensacola. Local lore also has it that <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> floors of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City were made from <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> wood of long-leaf yellow pine trees felled in <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> area. <BR><BR>Florida's 170,383 square km (65,785 square miles) make it <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> twenty-second largest U.

However, since <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> mean elevation of <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> entire state is only about 30 meters (100 feet), Florida doesn't offer much in <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> way of mountain vistas. Nevertheless, <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> view from <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">the</SPAN> <SPAN class="""" id=st name=""st"">summit</SPAN> of Britton Hill is pleasant.

40,23,"""A Cruise to Some Little-Known Brazilian Islands: Fernando de Noronha and St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in May 2005<BR><BR> </SPAN><P ><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Sx5fBNtPA"">St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks, Brazilian equatorial islands, 33-second video clip</FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zRZxNdJdm8""><FONT size=4>Masked booby flying in the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, 120-second video clip</FONT></A></P><P ><BR>In March 2005 I sailed on the 382-passenger Silversea cruise ship MV <I>Silver Shadow</I> from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Lisbon, Portugal. In the Western Hemisphere my cruise ship was to call at the ports of Salvador and Natal in northeastern Brazil as well as the small Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha, which lies at latitude 3.85 S. and longitude 32.42 W., some 214 miles (345 km) off the coast of Brazil. In the Eastern Hemisphere my repositioning cruise was also to include calls at the following ports: Dakar, Senegal; Tenerife, Canary Islands; and Funchal, Madeira.<BR><BR>For the first six days the <I>Silver Shadow</I> kept to the published cruise itinerary. But on March 13 at 7 a.m. when the ship arrived at Fernando de Noronha we encountered a six-foot (two-meter) northeasterly swell. <BR><BR>The smaller Hapag-Lloyd cruise ship MV <I>Bremen</I>, which had been lying at anchor off Fernando de Noronha since the previous day, was able to disembark its passengers onto the island on the morning of March 13 via the fleet of inflatable Zodiacs which it carries on board. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, however, the six-foot (two-meter) swell was sufficient to prevent <I>Silver Shadow</I> passengers from disembarking safely into the ship's tenders or onto a trawler. Many of the ship's 284 passengers (the vessel was only three-quarters full) had signed up for three-hour ""Archipelago by Trawler"" excursions that were to have included an opportunity for swimming. These tours had to be cancelled. <BR><BR>Rather than commencing disembarkation procedures, the <I>Silver Shadow</I> instead made a two-hour counter-clockwise circumnavigation of the island. Captain Emanuele Chiesa also announced that, in consolation, he would deviate from the planned transatlantic route in order to view the seldom-visited mid-Atlantic rocks of St. Peter and St. Paul at about 9 a.m. on the morning of March 14. <BR><BR>Of course most passengers were disappointed not to be able to set foot on Fernando de Noronha. However, I had already flown to Fernando de Noronha in February 2001 prior to a previous cruise I had taken on MV <I>Silver Shadow</I> from Rio de Janeiro on Cape Town via Ascension and St. Helena in March 2001. So I was not as disturbed as were the other passengers; and, in fact, I welcomed the opportunity to trade a second visit to Fernando de Noronha for a chance to sail by and photograph St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks. <BR><BR>Originally called Ilha da Quaresma, or Lent Island, Fernando de Noronha was probably first sighted by the Portuguese expedition to Brazil led by Fernao de Loronha in 1501-1502. However, as Amerigo Vespucci, who traveled to Brazil with a Portuguese expedition in 1503, was the first person to describe the archipelago, he is often credited with its discovery.<BR><BR>Between 1534 and 1737 Fernando de Noronha changed hands between the English, French, Dutch and Portuguese a number of times. Finally in about 1770 Vila dos Remedios, the first permanent Portuguese settlement, was established. Brazil's independence in the nineteenth century had little impact on the archipelago. In the first half of the twentieth century the English, the French and the Italians all had some involvement with the island in connection with transatlantic cable communications. The island also served as a prison for many years.<BR><BR>The U. S. built an airfield on Fernando de Noronha during World War II. This was one of a chain of airfields which stretched from Florida all the way to Egypt via South America and Central Africa. Aircraft were flown from the U. S. to North Africa by this circuitous route in order to support the Allied war effort. U. S. troops remained on the island from 1942 to 1945. Later, NASA maintained a missile tracking station there from 1957 to 1962. <BR><BR>Of the 21 islands in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, only the main island is inhabited. The total land area of the archipelago is 10 square miles (26 square km); and the highest peak, Morro do Pico, reaches 1,053 feet (321 meters). There is a permanent population of about 1,300. The few historical sites of interest to the tourist include a Portuguese-built fort and a church in the hamlet of Vila dos Remedios. Nowadays there is daily air service to Fernando de Noronha (airport code FEN) from Recife, Brazil via Boeing 737 jet. <BR><BR>During the five centuries since its discovery, some 95% of Fernando de Noronha's native vegetation and trees was destroyed. The marine national park which was declared in 1989 set aside about 70% of the archipelago as a sanctuary. Today Fernando de Noronha is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to the existence of the marine national park, cruise ships such as <I>Silver Shadow</I> now can only lie at anchor off the northwest coast of the island. <BR><BR>No more than 480 tourists are allowed on the island at any one time. An environmental preservation tax is imposed on island visitors by the state government. Interestingly, this tax escalates the longer one remains on the island! <BR><BR>With an average annual water temperature of 75 F. (24 C.) and underwater visibility of up to 131 feet (40 meters), diving has become Fernando de Noronha's primary tourist attraction. The archipelago boasts white sandy beaches lapped by waters untainted by silt from Brazilian rivers. There are 230 species of fish and 15 varieties of coral in the archipelago. Dolphins, stingrays, whales, five types of sharks and two species of marine tortoise all inhabit the archipelago. <BR><BR>Twenty-four species of marine birds are also to be found. I was captivated by the scores of masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) which followed the <I>Silver Shadow</I> on March 13 as the ship circumnavigated and then sailed away from Fernando de Noronha. <BR><BR>The family Sulidae contains nine species of boobies and gannets. Both boobies and gannets are conspicuous at sea due to their large size, high flight and spectacular diving habits. Both boobies and gannets have long pointed bills, webbed feet and pointed wings. Although resembling a gannet superficially, the masked booby's head is completely white and the coloration resembles a black face mask. In addition, the masked booby is broader than the gannet, and there is a more extensive trailing edge to the wings of the former. <BR><BR>Early mariners, who found that boobies exhibited no fear of humans, killed them easily for food. Because these birds appeared tame, they were called boobies after the Spanish word bobo which means ""stupid."" <BR><BR>With a length of 34 inches (86 cm) and a width of 60 inches (152 cm), the masked booby is the largest and heaviest of the boobies. According to the <U>National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region</U> by John Bull and John Farrand, Jr., published in New York in 1994 by Alfred A. Knopf, the masked booby is ""a stocky white seabird with a black tail, black tips and trailing edges to the wings."" It bears a pinkish or orange bill; and during the breeding season the booby exhibits a patch of bare, bluish skin at the base of the bill. <BR><BR>Preferring deep water for fishing, the booby executes near-vertical plunge-dives in search of flying fish and/or squid. In fact, boobies are seldom found in regions where flying fish and squid are not plentiful. I found that a booby would often let out a squawk similar to that of a duck prior to plunging deep into the Atlantic as if it were a vertical torpedo. Other boobies, upon hearing the squawking, would plunge into the ocean nearby. Peter Harrison in <U>Seabirds of the World A Photographic Guide</U>, published in London in 1996 by Christopher Helm Ltd., mentions that the masked booby, which is pantropical, is a colonial breeder on islands, including the south Atlantic islands of Fernando de Noronha and Ascension Island where it normally lays two chalky, pale blue eggs in a shallow depression.<BR><BR><U>The Field Guide to the Birds of North America</U>, third edition, published in Washington, DC in 1999 by the National Geographic Society, points out that the masked booby breeds as far north as Florida's Dry Tortugas. This booby is also sighted rarely in the Gulf Stream as far north as the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The bird is seen only occasionally in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer. The masked booby is loosely gregarious at sea but is said not to follow ships usually. In fact, the many masked boobies which accompanied us on March 13 were no longer in evidence the following day. <BR><BR>At 9 a.m. on March 14 the <I>Silver Shadow</I> arrived one mile (1.6 km) off St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks, which lie at latitude 0.93 N. and longitude 29.35 W., more than 496 miles (800 km) off the coast of Brazil. These equatorial Brazilian islands, composed of mylonitic peridotite, are of volcanic origin. The island group, some 820 feet (250 meters) wide and with a maximum height of 64 feet (19.5 meters), is the peak of a submarine mountain which extends 13,123 feet (4,000 meters) down to the sea bed below. <BR><BR>St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks are of interest primarily because they are so far offshore in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These isolated islands represent one of the very few places where a mid-oceanic ridge attains a height which is above sea level. In effect, these mid-Atlantic rocks serve as an oasis for marine life within an otherwise deep water environment. <BR><BR>There is no source of fresh water on the rocks other than rain, and the islands themselves are devoid of vegetation with the exception of two types of algae. But the marine flora and fauna provide a significant food source for the seabirds which reside and breed there. A 1971 biological survey by Smith et al.* showed that the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the brown noddy (Anous stolidus) and the black noddy (Anous minutus) all breed on these rocks and that these birds' eggs are sometimes eaten by crabs (Grapsus grapsus), which occur there in large numbers. Incidentally, all three of these birds are also said to breed on Ascension Island.<BR><BR>While it appears that scientists, amateur radio enthusiasts and Brazilian military personnel may have been the only visitors to St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks in recent years, interestingly, these isolated islands were also visited by Charles Darwin in HMS <I>Beagle</I> in 1860 and by H. N. Moseley in HMS <I>Challenger</I> in 1879. Both naturalists reported seeing vast numbers of sea birds during those nineteenth century calls. However, multitudes of sea birds are no longer in evidence today. This may be due to human interference on the islands. A lighthouse, a radio tower, a house and a shed have been constructed on one of the islands. There is also a wooden stairway running down to a small dock area. <BR><BR>The decline in bird life may also be due to extensive fishing in the area by boats from Brazil.

The museum's floor area is 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters), nearly half of which is exhibition space.

42,23,"""A Suez Canal Transit,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in October 2008 <br /><br />During the quarter of a century that I have lived in Egypt I have driven along the highway that runs parallel to the Suez Canal several times while taking day trips to Port Said. I have seen large and small ships steaming through the Great Bitter Lake when on holiday near Fayid. I once crossed the canal on a small car ferry when returning to Cairo from El Arish; and of course I have driven through the 1.63-km (1-mile)-long Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the canal many, many times en route to and from various Sinai beach resorts. (I haven't had a chance yet to drive over the canal at El Qantara on the beautiful Mubarak Peace Bridge which opened in October 2001. This, the Egyptian-Japanese Friendship Bridge, which was built with Japanese assistance, has a clearance of 70 meters or 230 feet.)</p>I have always been intrigued to see vessels plying the Suez Canal. Indeed, the ship convoys often appeared to be floating across the desert as if by magic if I was situated far enough away from the canal at the time of sighting. So I'm sure no one will be surprised when I admit that I have long wondered how a local resident could sail through the canal. </p> Unfortunately, I never found an answer to that question. However, in the autumn of 2004 and again in the spring of 2008 I was able to join two international cruises which included Suez Canal transits. In November 2004 I sailed south from Alexandria to Mombasa, Kenya on the 10,000-ton, 208-passenger <i>Seabourn Spirit</i>; and in May 2008 I sailed north during an Africa circumnavigation cruise on Holland America Line's 38,000-ton, 793-passenger <i>Prinsendam</i>.</p>The Suez Canal was constructed by forced labor at a cost of USD 100 million over a 10 1/2-year period by Ferdinand de Lesseps' Universal Company for the Suez Maritime Canal, which was formed in 1858. The canal was opened on November 17, 1869 by the French Empress Eugenie. 163 km (101 miles) long and 600 meters (1,968 feet) wide in its narrowest stretch, the canal links the Mediterranean at Port Said to the Red Sea at Suez. With an average transit time of 15 hours, the canal saves ships 11,829 km (7,350 miles) compared to the circumnavigation of Africa.</p>The Suez Canal, which has no locks, accommodates about 50 ships daily and is capable of handling up to 80 ships in a single day. The current maximum draft allowed is 16 meters (53 feet), and modifications now underway should increase this to 22 meters (72 feet). While ships which displace up to 150,000 tons can now transit the canal, after 2010 fully-laden supertankers will also be able to pass. At present supertankers have the option of transferring a portion of their cargo onto an Egyptian boat and then reloading after their canal transit. </p>Incredibly, the average toll is USD 205,000. So it is difficult to imagine what the cost must be to operate a supertanker all the way around the Cape of Good Hope. No wonder supertankers would bother to offload and reload cargo in order to transit the canal! In 2005 some 18,193 vessels, or about 7.5% of worldwide shipping, crossed through the Suez Canal. Transit fees routinely total well over USD 3 billion.</p>While only a single shipping lane exists in the canal, there are two major turnouts for passing. Typically three convoys transit the canal daily. The initial southbound convoy departs Port Said and proceeds as far as the Great Bitter Lake south of Ismailia. There the convoy awaits the northbound convoy before continuing south to Suez. The second southbound convoy is passed by the northbound convoy in the bypass at El Ballah between Ismailia and El Qantara. In order to reduce erosion, transit speeds are held to about 8 knots or some 15 km (9 miles) per hour. </p>Both of my Suez Canal transits were a little unusual. The journey begins very early in the morning no matter which direction one's ship is traveling. In 2004 <i>Seabourn Spirit</i> got the usual pre-dawn start from Port Said. But our southbound transit time was greatly increased due to a reported minor ship collision in the northbound convoy. The ensuing delay caused us to be sidelined in the Great Bitter Lake for a number of extra hours, and we only exited the canal at Suez very late that night. </p>On the other hand, in 2008 the captain of the <i>Prinsendam</i> was contacted by Suez Canal Authority officials a couple of hours early, at about 4 AM, and told to proceed as the lead ship in that day's northbound convoy. As the captain thought it best to avoid making a public announcement on board at that early hour, by the time most passengers awoke, expecting to see Suez from their balconies, our ship was already sailing in the Little Bitter Lake.</p>As is the case on Nile cruises, passengers who transit the Suez Canal will glimpse many interesting vignettes of local life. The bad news is that, while lying at anchor, the local flies are nothing short of murderous!</p>Unfortunately there is still no way for locals to enjoy a simple transit of the Suez Canal. Only those willing to consider taking a full cruise will ever have the unique opportunity to experience a Suez Canal transit.<br /><a target=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtYjRq_fQjc"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=eM8y_WYVmnI"">Suez Canal panorama showing El Ballah Bypass, 60-second video clip</a> <br /><br />Ted Cookson<br />Manager - Maadi<br />Egypt Panorama Tours<br />6 October 2008<br /><a href=""http://www.eptours.com/""><font color=""#006699"">www.eptours.com</font> </a><br /> <a href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""><font color=""#006699"">www.tedcookson.com",372
43,23,"-""A Visit to Easter Island, 'Navel of the World,'"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2004 </P><P>On 25 January 2003 I sailed from Valparaiso, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on the 513-passenger German-registered cruise ship MS Deutschland. During the 16-day cruise the Deutschland called at Chile's Robinson Crusoe Island, Easter Island and Pitcairn Island as well as Fakarava and Moorea in French Polynesia. On 1 February I toured Easter Island for the third time in 2 1/2 years! Cruise ships often call at both Pitcairn Island and Easter Island when sailing between Tahiti and South America's west coast ports. So it was due to my interest in trying to land at Pitcairn Island that I also happen to have visited Easter Island on cruises in both 2000 and 2002.<BR><BR>Easter Island is some 3,600 km west of Chile. Pitcairn Island, 1,900 km distant, is its nearest inhabited neighbor to the east. Triangular in shape and hilly, with a maximum altitude of 600 meters, Easter Island is 23 km long, 11 km wide and has an area of 163 square km (63 square miles). Easter Island, with an extinct volcano at each corner, was formed by a series of separate underwater volcanic eruptions.<BR><BR>Dutch admiral Jakob Roggeveen, who discovered the island on Easter Sunday in 1722 and spent only a single day there, described a population which worshiped huge standing statues with fires while they prostrated themselves to the rising sun. The island was also visited by an expedition sent by the Spanish viceroy of Peru, which spent four days on the island in 1770. This expedition reported that the local population of 3,000 had its own form of script. It appears that a civil war may have taken place prior to the visit of Captain James Cook in 1774. Cook found only 700 poverty-stricken men and fewer than 30 women on the island. He wrote that most of the statues had been overturned and were no longer venerated.<BR><BR>In 1864 a French Catholic missionary, the first European to settle on Easter Island, converted the population to Christianity. Settlers from Tahiti began to raise sheep on the island in 1870. In 1888 the island was annexed by Chile. Easter Island was administered by the Chilean navy for 11 years from 1954, but since 1965 Easter Island has had a civilian governor.<BR><BR>The population was decimated to a low of 111 in 1877 by Peruvian slavers, smallpox, tuberculosis and emigration. Today's population of about 3,000, living in the town of Hanga Roa on the sheltered west coast, has been augmented by emigrants from the Chilean mainland. Tourism, the mainstay of the modern economy, began with commercial air service in 1967. Nowadays about half a dozen cruise ships also call at Easter Island annually. Chile has declared the entire island a historic monument.<BR><BR>Polynesian culture was able to spread across the Pacific within the great triangle formed by New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island due to the fact that Polynesian mariners had devised ways to navigate in small boats between very widely-dispersed islands. Also known as Rapa Nui, its Polynesian name, Easter Island was probably colonized by mariners from the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia in about 400 AD. The oldest ceremonial altars and statues are similar to those found in the Marquesas. However, later development of the tall gaunt statues with elongated faces and ears for which Easter Island is famous is unique to Easter Island. Mysterious ""rongorongo"" hieroglyphs found on the island have never been deciphered. Curiously, the first inhabitants called their island ""Navel of the World.""<BR><BR>It is thought that five clans on Easter Island, each of which had its own lands, attempted to display their strength through the construction of complex monuments of ancestor worship. Incredibly, over the centuries about 1,200 monolithic stone statues were quarried at Rano Raraku, on the sides of an extinct volcano. The statues were then transported to their various resting sites on the periphery of the island, perhaps by means of wooden rollers. (A 1986 experiment showed that it was also possible for 15 men to move a medium-sized statue in an upright position by means of ropes.) Each statue originally wore a red topknot which was quarried at another location distant from Rano Raraku. In addition, large round pebbles laid out in long rows in front of the statues were all gathered from one particular beach. Virtually all of the statues faced inward so as to watch over the clans' ancestral lands.<BR><BR>The remarkable monoliths, carved from tuff, a soft volcanic stone, range in height from 3 to 12 meters. Some weigh more than 45,500 kg (50 tons). The largest weighs 74,500 kg (82 tons) and wore a topknot weighing 10,000 kg (11 tons). It has been theorized that the engineers, quarrymen and sculptors were paid from surplus agricultural production by the families which commissioned the statues. After about 1400 AD the quarrying slowed and then eventually ceased. This might have been due to deforestation caused by production of rollers which in turn led to soil infertility. Heavy cropping may have contributed too. Today Easter Island is mostly grassland aside from some introduced eucalyptus trees. It is still possible to see the remains of hillside trails created by sheep which were ranched on the island for a century until the mid-1980s.<BR><BR>Another interesting but later phenomenon is the birdman cult. In an annual ceremony young men raced down steep volcanic cliffs and swam to three small islets offshore to try to obtain the first egg laid by the sooty tern, a migratory seabird which still nests there. The chief of the clan of the winner of this race was named Bird Man. This position apparently allowed that elder to govern Easter Island for the next year.<BR><BR>In addition to the obvious Polynesian cultural borrowings, some strong arguments can also be made for influences from South America to the east. In particular, the stone work on one of the ceremonial altars and at the ceremonial village of Orongo are similar to masonry in South America. Also, the early Easter Island statues bear characteristics reminiscent of pre-Inca monuments.<BR><BR>As Easter Island has no cruise ship dock, the Deutschland stayed at anchor; and I rode ashore in the morning on the ship's tender. Riding horses were available for rent at the small dock. But to see the most in a short amount of time, a vehicle is best. My day tour began with a drive up the steep slope of Rano Kau, the largest volcano, to the ceremonial village of Orongo which consists of low stone buildings associated with the Bird Man cult. Petroglyphs there show a creature which is half man and half bird. From Orongo I could look out to sea toward the nearby islets where the annual Bird Man competition was held. From this same vantage point I could also see the fresh water lake in the crater far below which provides sufficient drinking water for the entire island.<BR><BR>I drove back down the slope of Rano Kau and then continued around the airport, the original runway of which was lengthened by NASA for use as an emergency landing strip for the space shuttle. Beyond the small town of Hanga Roa I reached the ceremonial altar known as Ahu Ko Te Riku. Not only is the statue here one of the few to again wear its original red topknot, but this is the only statue which currently contains eyes. It was only in the 1990s when a single eye-shaped coral piece was unearthed that archeologists realized that all of the statues originally had eyes carved from white coral. The pupils were made of dark stone.<BR><BR>From there I drove to the volcanic crater Rano Raraku where all of the statues were quarried. Some statues still recline in situ, only partially excavated. Many others lie abandoned nearby, having broken at the very beginning of their separate journeys to the various clans' lands around the island.<BR><BR>The quarrying at Rano Raraku took place with basalt picks both inside and outside of that lake-filled crater. Today statues stand buried near the quarry site at random depths and at random angles. Some statues are buried by silt to their abdomens or waists, some to their necks and still others to their chins. Nearly all of the statues are cut off at waist level. On only one of the remaining statues are stubby legs carved on its sides. Interestingly, one statue has a three-masted sailing ship inscribed on its chest. This artwork must have been added sometime after the arrival of the first Europeans in the eighteenth century.<BR><BR>My next stop was the largest ceremonial altar, Ahu Tongariki, where 15 statues stand on the same platform facing inward from the sea. In 1960 a tsunami caused by an earthquake near the coast of Chile swept all 15 statues off their platform, hurling some of these huge stone megaliths hundreds of meters inland. My guide explained that a Japanese owner of a crane company had donated one of his cranes for use in restoring this altar after returning home from a visit to Easter Island.<BR><BR>The final destination on my tour was Anakena, Easter Island's only true sand beach where the ceremonial altar Ahu Nau Nau contains half a dozen statues, four of which wear red topknots. A plaque at Anakena records the visit by Thor Heyerdahl to this site in the mid-1950s. After a picnic lunch I returned to the town of Hanga Roa to try to see the museum. Unfortunately the museum was closed due to the 10-day-long Semana Rapa Nui, a festival with dancing, singing, tattooing and body-painting plus horse racing and swimming competitions, which was due to commence that evening.<BR><BR><BR></P><P>HOW TO GET TO EASTER ISLAND:</P><P>LAN Airlines offers frequent air service to Easter Island from both Santiago, Chile and Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia.

44,23,"HOW TO GET TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P>British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is most easily reached by yacht charter from the Maldives. However, some travelers have also sailed to BIOT by yacht charter from the Seychelles. The sailing time to BIOT from Seychelles is substantially longer than what is required from Gan (Addu Atoll) in the Maldives. </P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P >""A Travelers Century Club Expedition to Remote British Indian Ocean Territory,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2002<BR> <BR>Membership in the Travelers Century Club (TCC), organized in Los Angeles in 1954 by a group of the worlds most widely traveled people, is limited to those who have visited 100 or more of the 317 destinations on the clubs list.<BR><BR>One of the most remote of those destinations is British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Formerly called the Oil Islands (oil refers to copra, or coconut oil, rather than to petroleum), BIOT consists of the Chagos Archipelago. Lying south of the Republic of the Maldives, BIOT consists of a number of atolls, the most southerly and the best known of which is Diego Garcia, where some of the U. S. aircraft employed in Afghanistan were based. In the northern reaches of BIOT are the Salomon Islands, which I visited by yacht 21-22 July 2002.<BR><BR>Our yacht charter was organized by club member Charles Veley who was attempting to visit the entire TCC list within a period of 15 months. Charles, in his mid-30s, also planned to be the youngest person to visit every destination on the TCC list. Charles had already found two others to share the steep yacht charter expenses, Jeff Shea and Ben Fogle. Jeff is another TCC member who is also an accomplished mountain climber. Ben Fogle, while not a TCC member, is a BBC travel show presenter who is writing a book on far-flung British overseas territories. (There may also eventually be a parallel BBC television program.)<BR><BR>On 17 July I flew Emirates from Cairo to the Maldives via Dubai. Upon arrival on the morning of 18 July I hopped a motorized ferry from the airport island across to Male, the capital, which is situated on a nearby island. Then early on the morning of 19 July we flew to Gan in a 15-passenger twin engine plane. <BR><BR>Upon arrival at Gan the four of us were met by two sedan cars which carried us a short distance to a spot where we could board a small motorboat to go out to our 94-foot sailing yacht, the Dream Voyager. Due to the peculiar geography of the Maldives, which consists of many small atolls, cars are rather uncommon. But during the British presence at Gan between 1957 and 1976 some 10 miles of road had been built at Addu Atoll by joining together several adjacent islands with causeways.<BR><BR>After customs clearance we finally set sail on the evening of 19 July in Dream Voyager south from Addu Atoll en route to the Salomon Islands in BIOT. We were sailing against a strong southeasterly wind, and the water was choppy. Although I was wearing an ear patch, I didn't feel like eating much for dinner. But I definitely felt better after losing lunch later that evening.<BR><BR>Our accommodations on the air-conditioned Dream Voyager were excellent. Each of us had his own bedroom with private sink, shower and toilet. The yacht carried a crew of eight, including an international captain. Due to Maldives maritime regulations, one captain had been required for the domestic journey from Male, from where the yacht had originally sailed with crew only; and we required a second captain for our international journey which began at Gan.<BR><BR>We sailed south all day on 20 July. Then on the morning of 21 July land was sighted. We could see the low-lying Salomon Islands atoll on the horizon. All of the islands are covered with a dense forest of coconut palms. About two hours later we sailed into the horseshoe-shaped atoll which opens to the north. We then turned right and dropped anchor off Boddam Island, one of ten islands in the atoll. The crossing had taken us about 40 hours.<BR><BR>The atolls of what is now BIOT used to fall under the political control of Mauritius. Then in the early 1970s the various islands were sterilized. The people living on Boddam Island and on other atolls in the Chagos Archipelago - about 2,000 in total - were ""compensated"" and shipped off to Mauritius. I heard that the dogs living on one of the islands were all gassed. BIOT was declared to be an independent political entity in 1972. The sterilization procedures apparently fulfilled the terms of an agreement under which the U. S. in 1972 took over Diego Garcia from the U. K. on a long-term lease. The British coast guard still patrols the waters of BIOT, and U. S. military personnel occupy only the large atoll of Diego Garcia with its air base in the far south.<BR><BR>The ""Ilois,"" people who had been removed from the Chagos Archipelago, recently won a court case against the U. K. This court decision will allow them to return to their former homes on Boddam Island and elsewhere in BIOT. We heard that a boat carrying a few of these islanders would soon be arriving in the Salomon Islands in order to check out the current situation there.<BR><BR>We landed on a pristine sandy beach on the northeast side of the still uninhabited Boddam Island on the morning of 21 July. Before I left Cairo I had commissioned the painting of a cloth banner which read, ""Travelers Century Club - BIOT 2002."" After taking photos of ourselves holding that banner, we began to explore, traversing the width of the island on a well-marked path. The western side of Boddam - without the protection of the atoll - offered rougher water and a much narrower beach with both sand and rocks.<BR><BR>Boddam Island contains the remains of a copra plantation. The old warehouse is connected to the dock bynarrow gauge railway tracks. The cement and coral walls of the buildings remain but some of the roofs have decayed. One of the old building stones bore the inscription, ""Cowen - England."" There is also a graveyard where headstones bear inscriptions dating back to the 1800s.<BR><BR>There are a church and a number of residential buildings. The latter, made of corrugated metal, still stand with their roofs intact. The interiors of some of the buildings have been spray painted with the names of yachts and yachters who have visited in recent years. One such yachter graffito, for instance, reads, ""Against all odds - Andy & Margaux, Australia 2001 - Love to live, live to love.""<BR><BR>We overnighted off Boddam Island along with a dozen or so other yachts which were anchored in the Salomons. This atoll serves as a way station for yachts crossing the Indian Ocean. For a $70 fee yachts are allowed to anchor for several months. Having chatted with a few of the yachters on Boddam, we learned that some yachters sail to BIOT, stay up to six months, and then simply return again after resupplying in Malaysia or Thailand. With E-mail available nowadays via short wave, yachters can easily stay in touch with the outside world even from somewhere as remote as BIOT.<BR><BR>Yachters sometimes congregate on Boddam Island in the evening in order to barbecue and socialize, and perhaps once a month the British coast guard sponsors a barbecue for all yachters present. There is a volleyball court, a swing made from rope and a half of a coconut shell and even a picnic table.<BR><BR>Although fishing is allowed in BIOT, diving is not. Regulations are enforced by and yacht fees are collected by the British coast guard which calls in at the Salomon Islands from time to time. We felt fortunate that Andy, a coast guard official, called on us the morning of 22 July because he stamped our passports!<BR><BR>Andy clearly was not looking for trouble when he boarded our yacht. He commented that, if we had any dive tanks on board, he didn't want to see them. I believe that anyone who had dived in the Salomon Islands would have said that it was the most fantastic dive he had ever taken since the water was so very clear.<BR><BR>After disembarking from our yacht, Andy returned to his coast guard vessel and sailed out of the Salomon Islands atoll in search of commercial vessels fishing in BIOT waters. He was also charged with inspecting these vessels.<BR><BR>On the afternoon of 22 July we rode our yacht's small motorboat from our anchorage near Boddam Island around the rest of the atoll. After landing on Takamaka Island we saw a ray swimming in the crystal clear water. Before returning to our own yacht across the lagoon, we halted to swim and snorkel at the site where another yacht had recently sunk. The sunken yacht's two white masts rose at an awkward angle out of the blue green waters of the Salomon Islands lagoon. We could see that a PC and other personal belongings were still aboard the sunken yacht, which bore a hole in its fiberglass hull.<BR><BR>Arriving back on the Dream Voyager, we found a Frenchman and his daughter from another yacht on board our own yacht sipping tea with our crew. They related to us the story of the sinking of the yacht in the lagoon two weeks previously. The family which owned it was then still in the lagoon, living aboard another boat with some friends. <BR><BR>The prevailing southeasterly wind assisted us on our northbound journey from the Salomon Islands in BIOT to Addu Atoll in the Maldives, so the return sailing took only about 38 hours.

45,23,"-""A Photo Safari Adventure: Following Wild Dogs in Botswana,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in October 2004 </P><P>""'Whiskey delta' on Hyena Alley,"" whispered Andre, our photo safari guide, into his two-way radio. ""We're following nine adults!""<BR><BR>Although he could boast 17 years of experience in animal conservation and guiding in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, 41-year-old South African-born Andre Joubert was as excited as were we early on the morning of September 10, 2004.<BR><BR>After a three-month absence, a pack of African wild dogs had returned to the flood plain around Zibalianja Camp near the Selinda Spillway, on the eastern edge of northern Botswana's game-rich Okavango Delta.<BR><BR>The 15,000-square-km Okavango Delta is well-known to informed African safari enthusiasts. Seasonal flood waters rising in Angola flow south into arid Botswana, creating the world's largest oasis. This unique ecosystem plays host to a large variety of African game animals and birds. Since good game sighting opportunities attract tourists, the Delta is also home to a great many safari lodges and camps. Until June 2004, guides from Zibalianja Camp (""Zib"") and neighboring Selinda Camp had frequently sighted wild dogs, which are also called ""Cape hunting dogs"" or ""painted dogs."" In fact, Zibalianja means ""place of the wild dog"" in the local Sesubiya tongue. However, as the flood plain had dried up and the game had thinned, the pack had moved away. Working co-operatively to bring down small animals such as impala, packs of wild dogs typically hunt over extensive and ever-shifting territories.<BR><BR>Our photo game drive had begun uneventfully that morning. We had photographed some elephants standing among trees on the flood plain as we had driven away from Zib. Then Andre spotted the footprints of a leopard which had crossed the dirt jeep track during the night. In following those leopard tracks, we came upon a sub-group of nine wild dogs hunting in tall grass. Strung out in a long line while attempting to flush out game, the dogs employed their seemingly oversized ears to their best advantage, listening carefully for the sound of potential prey or for a call from another member of the pack.<BR><BR>As we followed behind the dogs in our open Land Cruiser, we were joined by other vehicles from Zib and Selinda camps, whose guides had all heard Andrew's radio announcement of the sighting. It soon became apparent that the dogs were returning from a morning hunt to the pack's den, which was now situated above the flood plain on a tree-shaded mound.<BR><BR>After parking our Land Cruiser and studying the dogs' activities at the den over a period of 45 minutes, we counted 16 month-old pups and 14 adults. In each pack of wild dogs it is customary for the alpha male to mate with only a single alpha female. In this case it was apparent that the alpha female's litter had been comprised of 16 healthy pups.<BR><BR>Our two-week African safari had commenced in Zambia, where we visited both South Luangwa National Park and Lower Zambezi National Park before flying via Lusaka to Livingstone, Zambia to view the magnificent and mighty Victoria Falls. There, adventurous tourists can choose to overfly one of the world's natural wonders in a small airplane, by helicopter or even in an ultralight. World-class white water rafting is also offered on the Zambezi River.<BR><BR>In years past more exciting adventure activities at Victoria Falls had been available from the Zimbabwe side than from Zambia. However, with Zimbabwe's growing political isolation and increasing economic difficulties, many tourists to Victoria Falls now prefer to stay at Livingstone on the Zambian side. The multitude of activities and breadth of accommodation currently on offer in Zambia are a reflection of the recent surge in tourism to that country.<BR><BR>From Livingstone we flew in a five-seat single-engine charter aircraft just across the border to Kasane, Botswana. After quickly clearing Botswana immigration formalities in Kasane, we continued in our light aircraft directly to a small dirt airstrip midway between the safari camps of Zib and Selinda. As we descended to land, we photographed hippos, elephants and herds of various antelopes, all of which were clearly visible on the plain below.<BR><BR>Intimate Zibalianja Camp, only a 15-minute drive from the airstrip and unusual in catering for a maximum of only six guests, features a unique bar overlooking a nearby water hole. The camp's four twin-bedded safari tents, raised on wooden platforms, are equipped with solar lighting. Each tent has a shaded cover as well as a mosquito net with zipper. Solar power allows for hot showers, and a modern bathroom with flush toilet is attached to each tent. There are wonderful views of the surrounding plain from the raised viewing deck. All meals and laundry service are included.<BR><BR>Daily activities include an early morning game drive followed by brunch. After relaxing around camp during the day, one's late afternoon game drive gradually turns into an evening drive when a strong hand-held spotlight is used for game spotting on the return to camp. Finally, a communal dinner is topped off by drinks around a campfire. Accompanied game walks, seasonal fishing in Zibalianja Lagoon and participation in monthly full moon night game counts are also possible. Wild dog, elephant, hippo, leopard, lion, cheetah, hyena, red<BR>lechwe, zebra, wildebeest, sable and other plains game have all been sighted at Zib and Selinda.<BR><BR>PRACTICALITIES AND SUGGESTIONS:<BR><BR>Botswana is unique in offering a combination of excellent game, small camps and open vehicles for game drives. In addition, a visit to nearby Victoria Falls can be combined easily with a Botswana safari. Beginning in November 2004, nonstop flights from Cape Town to Maun, Botswana will permit direct access to northern Botswana, eliminating the need to change aircraft in Johannesburg. Maun is the departure point for most small aircraft flights to the many safari camps located all across the Okavango Delta.<BR><BR>An ideal, if high budget, southern African experience might consist of a visit to Victoria Falls plus stays at both a wet camp (for canoeing) and a dry camp (for game viewing in vehicles) in the Okavango Delta, followed by four nights in Cape Town. South Africa's so-called ""Mother City"" should be savored for a minimum of three full days in order to include a visit to the nearby Cape Point Nature Reserve, the wine country surrounding Stellenbosch and Paarl, and Cape Town's own highlights. The latter include Table Mountain, Robben Island and the many shopping opportunities at the Waterfront and Greenmarket Square.<BR><BR>The Southern Hemisphere winter months of April through October are the best time to visit the Okavango Delta. September is an excellent month as then the grasses are low, making game viewing easy. During the period from November through March, when there is rain and the grass is high, the Okavango Delta boasts a profusion of bird life.<BR><BR>In early October 2004 round trip airfare from Cairo to Cape Town on Kenya Airways was approx. USD 838. Round trip airfare from Cape Town to Maun, Botswana is expected to be approx. USD 580. Consider asking your travel agent to construct a safari package which includes three nights of accommodation at Zibalianja Camp plus airfare from Maun to Zib and then from Zib onward to Livingstone, Zambia in order to view Victoria Falls. If your budget allows it, since Kenya Airways also services Lusaka, Zambia, open jaw international airfare could be arranged, as follows: Cairo-Nairobi-Johannnesburg-Cape Town plus Livingstone-Lusaka-Nairobi-Cairo. Frequent commuter-type scheduled charters operate between Livingstone, Zambia (at Victoria Falls) and Lusaka. <BR><BR>Scheduled air service to Botswana exists from most of its neighboring countries.

47,23,"-""Some Tips on Turkey,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2004<BR> <BR>For many years Turkey was a perennial favorite among travelers from Egypt. Turkey is close to Egypt and it boasts a number of fascinating sights from various cultures and eras. In addition, inexpensive airfare and accommodation are available, domestic transportation is plentiful and convenient, and there are terrific shopping opportunities! <BR><BR>While Turkey still has a lot going for it, some travelers have shied away from Turkey in recent years. The ongoing dispute with the Kurds, who have long sought greater autonomy, caused only occasional hiccups in foreign tourist arrivals during the 1990s. However, the devastating earthquake of August 1999 gave Turkish tourism a hard punch. And this was later followed by a couple of terrorism incidents which have dealt tourism in Turkey a severe body blow.<BR><BR>But, if you are a contrarian traveler, you might well consider this to be a good time to go! <BR><BR>While those without much time to spare may prefer to concentrate only on Istanbul with its Ottoman-era tourist sites, Turkey has three other well-traveled destinations with special appeal for active tourists. Cappadocia, within driving distance of Ankara in central Turkey, contains elaborate and extensive caves and rock-carved churches. The area immediately north and south of Izmir on Turkey's Aegean coast is well-known for its Roman-era antiquities, including the world-class ruins at Ephesus. Finally, for those summer holiday makers seeking some sun, Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast is famed for its beautiful beaches. <BR><BR>Istanbul, with a population of about 10,000,000 and boasting five palaces and some 20 museums, is overflowing with tourist sites, most of which reflect its former power and wealth as the seat of the Ottoman Empire. The large and ornate buildings give visitors a sense of the greatness of the past. Topkapi Palace, built by Mehmet the Conqueror between 1459 and 1465, served as the sultan's court until 1853. In its heyday the palace housed over 5,000 people.<BR><BR>The Archeological Museum, one of Istanbul's most important museums, contains some outstanding works among the 60,000 exhibits in its Greco-Roman and Near Eastern collections. The best known exhibit is probably the magnificent so-called Alexander sarcophagus from Lebanon which is decorated with images of Alexander the Great. But the treaty of Kadesh, the world's first peace treaty signed between the ancient Egyptians and the Hittites, is also in the museum. Such documents were recorded in that era on clay tablets. <BR><BR>Istanbul is known for the Ayasofia, or Haghia Sophia, one of the world's greatest architectural creations. Built by Justinian in about 535 A. D., the church was converted into a mosque after the Ottomans conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453. Now a museum, visitors are awed by the size of the building's interior. Opposite the Ayasofia is Istanbul's most famous place of worship, the Blue Mosque, constructed in the early seventeenth century and characterized by its six minarets and by its interior walls which are covered with beautiful blue tiles manufactured in Iznik. Rumeli Fortress, a half day's boat ride up the Bosphorus from Istanbul, is another popular tourist destination.<BR><BR>It has been suggested that Istanbul's Covered Bazaar, stuffed with over 4,000 stalls and shops, was the world's first mall. While shopping in the bazaar can be a cultural experience, with the mandatory bargaining and tea drinking, nowadays Istanbul also sports huge modern malls which feature fixed prices. Turkey offers terrific bargains on such items as clothing, shoes and leather products of all types; and the country's biggest selection is to be found in Istanbul. <BR><BR>Ankara is the departure point for the region of Cappadocia, a 300 km drive from Ankara's Esenboga Airport. The route is a pleasant one, with snow-capped mountains in the distance and a caravan-serai to visit en route. Cappadocia, lying at an altitude of 1,000 meters, was first explored by a Western visitor only in 1705. The area retains a magical aura due to its mushroom-shaped geological formations created by the erosion of tuff, a soft stone. Some of the dwellings and other monuments date back as far as the third century A. D. Entire underground cities were built when monastic groups fled religious persecution and also later when Byzantines sought refuge from Arab attackers. Today one can still see religious paintings of historical interest which were left by these early troglodytes.<BR><BR>As strange as it may seem today, the western coast of modern-day Turkey was one of the most populated parts of the ancient world. Primarily south of Izmir the Greeks established Ionian cities whose prosperity exceeded that of mainland Greece. Later these same cities were among the richest in the Roman Empire. Today Ephesus is by far the most visited of Turkey's ancient Greek cities. In fact, Ephesus' Temple of Artemis (also known to the Romans as Diana), three times as large as the Parthenon in Athens, was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Founded in the tenth century, Ephesus was laid out on a grand scale, and there is still plenty of interest to see today.<BR><BR>Perhaps because of the overwhelming reputation of Ephesus, many tourists give other nearby antiquities short shrift. Ancient Pergamum (modern Bergama) is only a two-hour drive north of Ephesus. Pergamum, which once had a population of 150,000 and was the most magnificent city in Asia Minor, is well worth a day trip. And a second wonderful day trip can be taken south from Kusadasi, the port and beach resort with plenty of hotels only a 20-minute drive from Ephesus. Driving south, one visits three very interesting classical sites. Priene was the first city in the world to be designed in a grid layout. Although now landlocked, the city of Miletus was a great maritime power until the fifth century when the nearby Meander River began to silt up, eliminating Miletus' access to the Aegean Sea. The dimensions of the ruined Temple of Apollo in the city of Didyma are overwhelming. Tourists are guaranteed to be impressed even though just three standing columns and a field of massive marble pieces remain today. The temple, which contained an oracle, was destroyed by the Persians in 494 B. C. <BR><BR>Antalya, the primary tourist city on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, was founded in the second century B. C. and today has a population of nearly 600,000. While primarily known for its beautiful beaches, there are also some antiquities to be seen in the vicinity.<BR><BR><B>FLIGHTS</B>: Turkish Airlines offers daily service to/from Istanbul, and Egypt Air also flies five times weekly. Flight time is scheduled for just over two hours, and the high season round trip airfare is approximately USD 341 on Turkish Airlines. This fare requires either a minimum stay of three nights or a stay over a Saturday night. The high season round trip airfare is approximately USD 316 on Egypt Air. This fare requires a minimum stay of three nights.<BR><BR>Turkish Airlines departs Cairo daily at 3:45 a.m. and departs Istanbul daily at 11:10 p.m. Egypt Air, on the other hand, departs Cairo at about 3:00 p.m. and departs Istanbul at about 6:20 p.m. on four of the five days it flies. <BR><BR>Connecting flights are available in Istanbul for onward destinations, including Ankara (for Cappadocia), Izmir (for Ephesus and other Greek- and Roman-era ruins) and Antalya (for the beach). Although the flight times of Turkish Airlines are less convenient, that airline offers round trip airfare to any city in Turkey via Istanbul for only about USD 70 in extra airfare and taxes. <BR><BR><B>ACCOMMODATION</B>: In the summer season a double room with breakfast at a 3-star hotel in Istanbul begins from about USD 35, and a double room with breakfast at a 4-star hotel in Istanbul begins from about USD 55. A double room with breakfast at a 5-star hotel in Istanbul runs upward from about USD 70 during the summer season. <BR><BR><B>VISAS</B>: Tourist visas currently run USD 30 for British citizens, USD 20 for U. S. citizens and USD 48 for Canadians. A support letter from an applicant's employer is requested by the Turkish consulate if visas are obtained in Cairo. Many nationalities can also purchase visas upon arrival at Istanbul International Airport.<BR><BR><B>TURKEY'S CLIMATE IN GENERAL</B>: The very best time to visit Turkey is April through June when it is warm and dry and there are still green landscapes after the winter rains. The second best time to visit is September through October when it is warm and dry and there are brown landscapes after the dry summer. The third best time to visit is July and August when it is hot, dry and dusty. This is also the peak season for tourism from Europe, so tourist hotels and flights are most crowded then. During the remainder of the year Turkey is cold and wet.<BR><BR><B>ISTANBUL CLIMATE</B>: The best time to visit Istanbul is April through mid-September when it is dry and hot. July and August are the hottest months, with afternoon temperatures of 28 C./82 F. In that region the best beach weather is June through September. During the period from November through February Istanbul is wet and cool. <BR><BR><B>IZMIR AND ANTALYA CLIMATE</B>: For the Aegean (Izmir) and Mediterranean (Antalya) coasts the best time to visit is April through October when it is hot and dry. The water temperature remains above 16 C./60 F., even during the winter. But it is beach weather only from April through October. While during the period from November through March it is mild and wet, the south coast is protected by mountains from the cold winds which blow from the north. Thus temperatures are mild there, averaging 14 C.-17 C./57 F.-63 F. in the afternoons. The western, or Aegean, coast averages 2 C./4 F. cooler than the southern, or Mediterranean, coast. <BR><BR><B>CAPPADOCIA AND ANKARA CLIMATE</B>: The Anatolian Plateau features very warm and dry summers from June through August. On the other hand, April, May and September are pleasantly warm. However, there can be occasional thunderstorms during this period; and evenings can be chilly. The winter season from November to March is cold and wet, with some snow. The eastern half of the Anatolian Plateau is colder and receives more snow than the western half. The snow can lie on the ground for up to four months. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",556
48,23,"-""An Amazon Adventure Cruise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in April 2003<BR> <FONT size=4><BR><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLG0WygW8ck"">Amazon rainstorm, 29-second video clip</A><BR></FONT><BR><BR>On 1 March 2003 I sailed from Manaus, Brazil to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida on the 208-passenger Bahamas-registered cruise ship <I>Seabourn Pride</I>. During the 16-day cruise the <I>Seabourn Pride</I> called at: Brazil's Anavilhanas Archipelago; the towns of Parintins and Santarem along the Amazon; Devil's Island off French Guiana; Bridgetown, Barbados; and Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas in the U. S. Virgin Islands. I will confine my remarks in this article to the Amazon portion of the cruise.<BR> <BR>Brazil, the world's fifth largest country, is nearly as large as the continental United States. Brazil shares borders with all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile. It is 4,350 km (2,700 miles) from Brazil's northern border to its southern border, and the distance from east to west is nearly the same. More than half of Brazil's population is under 30 and, collectively, Brazilians represent one of the world's broadest ethnic blends. <BR> <BR>The Spanish soldier Francisco de Orellana was the first European to explore the Amazon in 1541. He is said to have given the river its name after reporting battles with tribes of female warriors. <BR> <BR>The Amazon River is the largest drainage system in the world in terms of both water volume and basin area. The total length of the Amazon from its headwaters in Peru to its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean is about 6,400 km (4,000 miles). Although this is slightly shorter than the Nile, it is still equivalent to the distance from Rome to New York City. The westernmost source of the Amazon lies only 160 km (100 miles) from the Pacific Ocean. The system consists of several main waterways and about 1,000 tributaries.<BR> <BR>The Amazon Basin, South America's largest lowland, occupies an area of 6 million square km (2.3 million square miles). This is almost twice as large as the basin of the Congo River, the earth's other great equatorial drainage system. Stretching some 2,782 km (1,725) miles from north to south at its widest point, the Amazon basin includes most of Brazil and Peru, major parts of Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia, and a small portion of Venezuela. About two-thirds of the Amazon's main stream lies within Brazil.<BR> <BR>Some 20% of all the fresh water on earth flows through the Amazon. The maximum flood discharge at the mouth of the Amazon is 175,000 cubic meters (6,180,000 cubic feet) per second. This is four times that of the Congo and more than ten times the amount of water carried by the Mississippi. A single day's discharge into the Atlantic is sufficient to supply New York City with a nine-year supply of fresh water. The Amazon's immense volume of fresh water dilutes the ocean's saltiness 161 km (100 miles) from shore. <BR> <BR>More than two-thirds of the Amazon basin is covered by an immense rain forest. In fact, the Amazon rain forest, which represents over one-third of the earth's remaining rain forest, also constitutes earth's largest reserve of biological resources. During recent decades deforestation has accelerated due to the development of new highways and airports and the discovery of minerals. The current population of Brazil's Amazon region is some 17 million, or 3.4 inhabitants per square km. 62% of this population lives in urban areas while only 38% lives in rural areas.<BR> <BR>In Brazil the name ""Solimoes"" is used for the Amazon from Iquitos, Peru to the mouth of the Rio Negro. Brazilians use the term ""Amazon"" (actually ""Amazonas"" in Portuguese) for the river only from the Rio Negro east to the Atlantic Ocean. Manaus (pronounced ""Man-awsh'""), the largest Amazon river city with a population of 1,300,000, is situated near the junction of the brownish-yellow (muddy) Rio Solimoes and the ""black"" Rio Negro. Interestingly, due to their different densities, velocities and temperatures, these two great rivers flow together for 6 km (4 miles) before mixing. A distinct stripe flows down the center until the two rivers eventually blend into a single uniform color. <BR> <BR>Manaus' most famous monument is its opera house, the Teatro Amazonas, which was inaugurated in 1896. Built over a 15-year period during Brazil's late nineteenth century rubber boom from materials imported from Europe, the 681-seat neoclassical opera house was last restored in 1990 and is still in use today. Only the wood for the floors and the chairs came from Brazil, and even that wood was sent to Europe for molding before being returned to the jungle for installation. <BR> <BR>Manaus' ingenious floating docks, constructed by a Scottish engineer at the beginning of the twentieth century, rise and fall by up to 10 meters (32 feet) with the Rio Negro's varying water level. At the Museu do Indio in downtown Manaus I viewed artifacts, costumes and weapons from the region's principal tribes. Due to a favorable exchange rate, the museum gift shop offered expertly-woven baskets from as little as USD 3; and I was able to purchase one large basket which stands a full meter high for only USD 9. One of the other highlights of my visit to Manaus was attending the very colorful Carnival parade there. <BR> <BR>On the second day of the cruise the <I>Seabourn Pride</I> anchored near the 145-km (90-mile)-long Anavilhanas Archipelago which consists of 400 islands and is situated northwest of Manaus on the Rio Negro. Unlike the muddy Solimoes (Amazon), the Rio Negro flows over a bed of fine sand that is free of sediment. Even though the Rio Negro's water appears black, it is said that its water is purer than tap water found in most urban areas. Also, incredibly, the Rio Negro is free of mosquitoes and many other types of insects. It is thought that the river absorbs plant materials which dissolve and add natural toxins. Though not harmful to fish or jungle animals which drink from the river, the poisons apparently inhibit the reproductive cycles of most insects.<BR> <BR>The Anavilhanas Archipelago is a developed jungle resort area. I took the opportunity to tour Ariau Amazon Towers, the largest tree top lodge. Established in 1986 with a mere eight rooms, today the resort boasts a helipad and can accommodate hundreds of guests. Ariau Amazon Towers has been frequented by the likes of Jimmy Carter, Helmut Kohl, King Guftav of Sweden and Susan Sarandon. I was shown the suite once occupied by Bill Gates which, incidentally, was even furnished with a PC and printer! <BR> <BR>Because the resort is built at the canopy level, the exotic flora and fauna of the Amazon rain forest are close at hand. Further exposure is also provided to guests through canoe rides in the creeks nearby. The Amazon region is host to 311 species of mammals, 2,600 species of birds and more than 400,000 kinds of insects. At Ariau Amazon Towers I saw and heard monkeys in the canopy as I walked along the resort's high wooden walkways, and both piranha and pink dolphins are said to live in the river there. <BR> <BR>Most people picture exotic animals and giant reptiles when they think of the Amazon. While there are many snakes and lizards, the Amazon Basin supports no large herding mammals like those found on the plains of Africa. Monkeys are the most diverse Amazon mammal group. The Brazilian rain forest supports six feline species, including jaguars, of which now only some 15,000 remain. Their biggest threat nowadays is deforestation rather than hunting. Rodents are the most abundant mammals in the Amazon. The Amazon's capybara is the world's largest rodent. The tapir, the largest mammal in the rain forest, grows to be up to 2 meters (6 feet) long. Tapirs feed on fruit and leaves and weigh about 182 kg (400 pounds). Northern Brazil's fish stocks are also abundant. More than 1,500 species have been classified. Some marine biologists estimate that up to 500 additional species may have yet to be discovered. <BR> <BR>The <I>Seabourn Pride</I> next called at Parintins, 564 km (350 miles) downstream from Manaus. With a population of 30,000, each June the 200-year-old town hosts a festival similar to Rio's Carnival. Amazonian legends, forest creatures and local and Andean rhythms are incorporated into this bizarre but fascinating spectacle. At the time of the annual festival the population swells more than tenfold as visitors arrive from all over Brazil. A special evening performance by exotic costumed dancers was staged for cruise passengers in the local open air cultural center. <BR> <BR>The final port of call on the Amazon was the city of Santarem. There a piranha fishing tour was offered. Piranha were caught and grilled on the spot with manioc flour. In fact, I saw fierce-looking mounted piranha being sold as souvenirs all along the Amazon. However, while piranha do certainly possess sharp teeth, it turns out that they are not nearly as fierce as their Hollywood-inspired reputation suggests. Locals bathe throughout the Amazon Basin alongside piranha without this fish causing them any harm. <BR> <BR>The final two days on the Amazon were among the most interesting, even though there were no ports of call. During the first portion of my cruise down the Amazon, the river and its tributaries were all very wide. However, northeast of Santarem as the ship began to weave through narrow channels to reach the Atlantic Ocean, vignettes of local life along the shores of these channels were presented to cruise ship passengers. While the backdrop was always dense rain forest, now I could easily see and photograph local people in their canoes, individual houses, small villages and even sawmills. Finally at Macapa our Amazon River pilot disembarked, and the <I>Seabourn Pride</I> sailed north to the Caribbean. <BR><BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO BRAZIL'S AMAZONAS STATE:</P><P>TAM offers daily air service between Miami and Manaus (pronounced ""Ma-nawh'"" in Portuguese), the capital of Amazonas State.</P>-Postscript: In November 2006 I sailed on Holland America Line's Prinsendam</EM> up the Amazon as far as Parintins which lies just inside the eastern border of Brazil's Amazonas State.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",578
49,23,"-""A Sightseeing Tour of Kabul, Afghanistan,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in January 2004 </P><P>About the size of Texas and with a population of 28,000,000, landlocked Afghanistan lies to the north and west of Pakistan, to the east of Iran and to the south of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Pashto and Dari are the primary languages. Sunni Muslims represent 84% of the population while Shi'a Muslims represent 15% of the population. <BR> <BR>Afghanistan has a continental climate with less than a meter of rainfall annually, most of which falls in March. The rest of the water supply comes from melting snow. Much of Afghanistan consists of empty desert or mountain ranges. Only a small portion of the land can be cultivated while the rest is barren. Since the late 1990's the country has been suffering from drought. <BR>Kabul, with a population of some 2,000,000, is the capital of Afghanistan. I made the notes below after visiting Kabul briefly in mid-July 2003. <BR> <BR>I departed from Cairo on 12 July 2003 at 6 p.m. on Kuwait Airways, and I arrived in Kabul on 13 July at noon local time, which is 2 1/2 hours ahead of Cairo time in the summer. En route I spent two hours at Kuwait International Airport and eight hours (overnight) at Dubai International Airport. Interestingly, my Ariana Afghan Airlines flight from Dubai to Kabul required only 2 1/2 hours in an aging 727. <BR> <BR>Upon arrival in Kabul, which lies at an altitude of 5,900 feet (approx. 1,800 meters), I found an interpreter and a driver with a van and proceeded to the so-called Inter-Continental Hotel which sits on a hill overlooking West Kabul. As I was only allowed to purchase a one way air ticket from Dubai to Kabul in Dubai, my first order of business upon arrival at the hotel was to purchase a Kabul-Dubai air ticket for USD 160 from Ariana Afghan Airlines. I also bought a guidebook on Kabul and some postcards at a bookstore and explored several gift shops. The airline office and the shops were all conveniently located in the lobby of my hotel. Then I went to bed as by then it seemed like I had not slept forever. <BR> <BR>For the record, my hotel had at one time actually been an Inter-Continental hotel. Nowadays, it is no longer part of that chain, but it continues to use its old name. At about USD 100 a night for a deluxe room, the hotel offers no air-conditioning; but at least electric fans are provided. This was important in July when daytime temperatures were in the 90s. <BR> <BR>On the morning of 14 July I awoke early and met my interpreter and driver for a sightseeing tour of the city. We began with a drive to the Kargha Dam about 20 minutes outside Kabul. Along the shore of the lake is a restaurant set in a grove of pine trees. My interpreter explained that locals sometimes enjoy picnics at this lake on Fridays. <BR> <BR>I continued on to West Kabul which had been a residential area at one time. But during the Afghan civil war thousands were forced to flee as rival Mujaheddin militias shelled the various avenues and villas from the surrounding hills. Today West Kabul is all but destroyed. <BR> <BR>Stopping by the Kabul Museum, I found painters and plasterers hard at work; so unfortunately there was nothing to be seen. At one time this museum was well-known for its extensive collection which extended from prehistoric times up to the twentieth century. However, during the past decade some 70% of its collection has been pilfered. <BR> <BR>Across the street from the Kabul Museum is Darulaman Palace, built in the 1920s by King Amanullah and later used as the Soviet embassy. While fighting from 1992 onward destroyed the palace building, it remains one of the most impressive structures in Kabul. <BR> <BR>The Kabul Zoo, which sports two pigs, some bears, a wolf and various other animals and birds, receives about 3,000 visitors a week. Blind in one eye and toothless, the Kabul Zoo's most famous resident, 40-year-old Marjan the lion, a gift from Germany, had managed to survive the intense fighting of the 1990s when the zoo had been in the line of fire of rockets fired from nearby hills. Marjan lost his eye when a Taliban fighter climbed into his cage in late 2001. Starving, Marjan ate the man. But the fellow's brother soon returned to seek revenge by throwing a grenade into Marjan's cage, leaving the lion both blind and lame. Marjan died several weeks later in January 2002. <BR> <BR>Next I visited the Babur Gardens. Built in the 1500s under Babur Shah, the great-grandson of Tamerlane, the gardens are contained within a large walled hillside compound. The bullet-pocked tombs of Babur Shah and his wife and family may still be viewed there today. A small marble mosque built by Babur's successor, Shah Jahan, in the middle of the sixteenth century, also survives. <BR> <BR>The last Afghan king, Zahir Shah, finally returned to Kabul in April 2002 after 29 years in exile in Italy. King Nadir Shah's Mausoleum is where the recent monarchs of Afghanistan's royal family are buried. A custodian will unlock the royal catacombs under the mausoleum for a small fee. Situated on a hilltop, the mausoleum offers a lovely view over Kabul. <BR> <BR>From that same hilltop one can see Bala Hissar, sometimes called the ""British fort."" This ancient citadel, perhaps dating back as far as the fifth century, was once used by the British as a barracks. As it is surrounded by unexploded ordinance, or ""UXO,"" the fort is currently off limits to tourists. Also visible from this hilltop is the stadium, where nowadays polo is played on Fridays but where, under the Taliban, public executions were staged. <BR> <BR>The money market is situated near the dry Kabul River in the city center. As U. S. dollars seemed to be accepted everywhere, I changed only USD 2, for which I received 96 Afghanis. The nearby ""Titanic Market,"" located in the dry bed of the Kabul River, is so named because, when the river occasionally floods, the market sinks. Factory-loomed Iranian carpets are displayed there. <BR> <BR>Finally, the Ariana graveyard at Kabul International Airport features trashed aviation memorabilia, mostly from 1960 to 1985. The ""collection"" also includes airplanes destroyed as recently as 2001 during coalition attacks. <BR> <BR>My overall impression of Kabul was that it is still essentially a wasteland. So many buildings have been destroyed in successive conflicts that it is difficult to imagine all of the firepower that had to have been released to do that amount of damage. My recommendation is to wait for at least five years before adding Kabul to your holiday itinerary. <BR><BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO AFGHANISTAN:</P><P>Kabul is accessible by air from a number of cities, including Baku, Delhi, Dubai, Frankfurt, Islamabad, London and Moscow. <BR><BR> <BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>21 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A>",472
50,23,"<body><p class=""MsoNormal"">""<b>Reunion Island, Secret of the Indian Ocean</b>,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2009 <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Reunion, an overseas department of France, is situated some 800 km (500 miles) east of Madagascar and 200 km (130 miles) southwest of Mauritius.  With a length of 63 km (39 miles), a width of 45 km (28 miles) wide, and an area of 2,512 square km (970 square miles), Reunion was visited by the Portuguese in 1635 and then first occupied by the French from 1642 to 1649.  Although under British control from 1810 to 1815, immigration from France over the succeeding two centuries plus immigration of Africans, Indians, Chinese and Malays has given rise to a mix of ethnicities on the island.      <br><br>My last visit to Reunion was by cruise ship in April 2008.  I had reserved a Hertz rental van which the firm had agreed via email to deliver at the port.  Although Hertz kept reassuring me by phone that the van was on the way and would arrive shortly, after an hour and 45 minutes of waiting I finally gave up and hired a taxi van for 200 euros to take our party of six on a six-hour circular drive around the beautiful verdant island.  <br><br>From the port at La Possession on Reunion&apos;s west coast we drove past the many beach resorts which stretch south from St. Paul 45 km (28 miles) to St. Louis.  The best sandy beaches are on the west coast of the island.  Although we didn&apos;t have time that day to make the side trip from St. Louis into the center of the island to view Cirque de Cilaos, luckily I had done that on a previous visit.  Reunion boasts three cirques, which are spectacular calderas in the interior of the island formed long ago by collapsing underground lava chambers.  Eventually deep canyons were eroded from these amphitheaters out to the sea.  The roads into the cirques wind through these canyons up to grand vistas of volcanic peaks and forested ravines.  The 37-km (22-mile) road from the coast at St. Louis up to Cilaos boasts over 400 bends.  Cilaos, situated at a height of 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) and with a population of 6,000, was developed as a spa in the late nineteenth century.  On 15-16 March 1952 1,870 mm (73.6 inches) of rainfall fell at Cilaos.  This is the world record for the most rainfall ever recorded in a 24-hour period!  Tourists with enough time should attempt to view or visit all three of Reunion&apos;s cirques. <br><br>From St. Pierre south of St. Louis we headed inland, driving up to Reunion&apos;s High Plains which lie at about 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) and which separate the island&apos;s cirques from its volcano.  As we climbed, the temperature became much more comfortable.  The highlight of our day trip to Reunion was the lunar-like crater of Piton de la Fournaise, one of the world&apos;s most active and yet most accessible volcanos.  This shield volcano has erupted more than 100 times since 1640.  The lava flow from Piton de la Fournaise is roughly three million cubic meters (about 4 million cubic yards) per day!   Piton de la Fournaise is similar to the volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii in that they are all located above hot spots in the earth&apos;s crust.<br><br>Following our visit to the volcano, we stopped at the Nez de Boeuf viewpoint over the spectacular canyon of the Riviere des Remparts.  A popular ten-hour walk leads from this point down the steep cliff and onward by trail through a national forest to the town of St. Joseph on the south coast.  Then, after crossing through Reunion&apos;s interior, we descended to St. Benoit on the island&apos;s east coast and then continued north to the capital of St. Denis.  Founded in 1668, St. Denis was named for a ship which had sunk there.  With a population of 140,000, St. Denis, constructed on a grid pattern along the north coast, has a few buildings  interesting for their architecture as well as a pretty seaside park.<br><br>Although the population of Reunion is over 800,000, about half of the inhabitants actually live in France.  Nevertheless, interestingly, there are some 340,000 automobiles on Reunion!  Needless to say, the road system is excellent, and there is a motorway which wraps around a fair amount of the island&apos;s coastline.<br><br>Reunion is not usually thought of as a dive destination.  However, the island&apos;s west coast boasts some colorful and even stunning diving sites offering a wide array of tropical fish.  In October and November pelagic species such as barracuda and tuna are also in evidence.  The Indian Ocean waters surrounding Reunion are warmest (28 C./82 F.) between October and April.  At the other extreme, water temperatures drop to 21 C./70 F. in August.  Divers will want to avoid the height of the cyclone season, which is in February and March.  (Cyclones may arise anytime from December through March.)  Reunion&apos;s hot and rainy summer stretches from December until April while the cool and dry winter lasts from the end of April until October.  Reunion attracts the most tourists from late June until early September but there are also tourists aplenty from October until early January. <span style=""color: black""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 12.0pt""> </p>  <span

0,8018,"During our trip to Rome, the Eternal City, in December, 2006, we spent a day visiting the land of the ""Holy See"".  The Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world.  It has it's own government and postal system.  Unfortunately no stamp in the passport, but no customs nonsense either.    After visiting the main Basilica of St Peter (which we have been to before), we headed over to the Vatican museum.  It was very crowded, think of the mall at Christmastime, only with more people.  Despite the hoards, we managed to see some of the famous sites and masterpieces, including the Sistine Chapel.  Unfortunately the Raphael's rooms were closed.  Sensory overload does not begin to describe how you feel when you visit the Museum.  Walls, ceilings, rooms, halls which go on and on, completely covered with more masterpieces than you can count.  It would probably take years just to enjoy each one.  Alas, no audience with the Pope, but since we are not Catholic, we got over it.  <br><br>",327
1,8018,"Rome, the Eternal City, a center of religion, history and culture.  In December, 2006, we spent 4 wonderful days in Rome.  Although we had been to Rome before on a short visit, this was the first chance where we could really spend some time, wander the streets and take a leisurely visit to many of the famous places.  We stayed in at the Hotel Settembre 95, a small boutique hotel located within a reasonable walk to many of the sites in Rome.  And walk we did.  While we saw much, we feel like we didn't even scratch the surface.  We could have spent weeks and still not take it all in.  Each day, we centered our explorations around a particular area.  One day we did historic Rome and Palantine Hill, on another, the Vatican area, on another the downtown, and on the last day we ventured outside Rome down the old Appian way. <br>Our first day, we spent time exploring the historical ancient Rome.  Surrounded by such antiquity and beauty, we allowed ourselves to get lost in the life of the ancient Etruscans and Romans.  Visiting such sites as the Coliseum, Palantine Hill, the Forum, and countless temples, statues, arches and monuments, we learned much about the history of this fascinating city.  The Michelin Green guide was an invaluable tool for us and for anyone who travels and is interested in the history and culture of an area.<br>The next day, we took the bus across the river to the land of the ""Holy See"", but I will cover that in that report.<br>The third day, was reserved for visiting the more modern center of the city and for shopping.  Wandering the Via Veneto, Quirinale, Castro Pretorio, Repubblica, and Trevi neighborhoods we visited an outdoor Christmas market at Piazza Navona along with many shops and small churches..  We bought some Christmas presents as well as ogled over all of the expensive designer items available in such abundance.  We also found time to just sit and relax, at a sidewalk cafe, as well as on the famous Spanish Steps, talking, and watching the throngs of interesting people pass us by.<br>On our final day we decided to venture outside the city, taking a bus and visiting the ancient Christian Catacombs and the old aqueduct along the Via Appia Antica (the Appian Way).  A very interesting and worthwhile trip.  Not only did we learn alot about ancient Christian history, but also enjoyed a nice jaunt down a very historical road.<br>Oh yes, one more thing.  We made sure to throw a coin over our shoulder into Trevi Fountain.  That way, according to legend, we will be assured that we will be returning to this magical city.<br>",891
2,8018,"Beijing, the capital city of the People's Republic of China.  An extremely fascinating city to visit.   Living in Japan, offered us wonderful opportunities to take short trips to China.  In November, 2004, we took a 5 day weekend and visited Beijing, which is Chinese for ""north Capital"".  We hired a private guide and driver for our time there, and it turned out to be a great idea.  Of course we visited most of the great sites in Beijing.  These included:<br>- Tiananmen Square - which is probably the largest public square we have ever seen<br>- The Forbidden City - which was home to the <br>- The Summer Palace - probably one of the most beautiful places in Beijing, but with a sad history for the Chinese people<br>- The Temple of Heaven - a site on the tourist trail, but compared to most of the other sites, it was just OK.  <br>- The Ming Tombs - which one stops at on the way to the Great Wall of China, and are very interesting.<br>- The Great Wall of China - This dwarfs any of the western Wonders of the World.  If you haven't walked on the Great Wall, you are missing an experience of a lifetime.<br>- The Yellow Temple (Huangshi) - not necessarily on the top tour itineraries, it is well worth a visit to see the beautiful buildings and the religious life of residents of Beijing.<br>Additionally, we had experienced some of the other things in China.  We visited the Beijing Zoo, which was a place to view the Giant Pandas.  A pretty nice zoo, which also had a wonderful tiger exhibit.  We attended a Chinese Opera.  While the music does take some getting used to from the standpoint of the western ear, but it is not an experience to be missed.  We even were able to go backstage and watch the performers apply their makeup.  It was interesting that each of the performers apply their own make-up in a careful, meticulous process.<br>Without a doubt, one of our favorite parts of the trip was taking a bicycle rickshaw ride through the hutongs.  The hutongs are narrow streets and alleys of the old style Chinese neighborhoods.  The hutongs have long been an important part of Chinese culture and status in the country.  We took a ride through the streets and neighborhoods, and even visited one of the homes.<br>One of the downsides of the trip is that since we hired a guide, they felt obligated to try and take us to every shop she could find.  A Tea house to buy tea (which actually was a nice side trip), a place to buy scroll paintings, a place to buy ceramics, a silk factory, a cloisonné factory, a jade factory, and probably a couple of others that I can't remember.  Obviously if we buy, the guide gets a cut.  Oh well, capitalism even comes to China.<br>",676
3,8018,"In November, 2009 my wife and I visited some friends in Morocco.  We spent time both in Casablanca and Rabat.  We really enjoyed our trip to Rabat, the capital city of Morocco, dwelling place of the king, ancient trade city, and much much more.  Rabat has large, tree lined streets which almost give the impression that you were in any Mediterranean city, until you reach the edge of the Royal Palace, a huge walled section of town which belongs to the King of Morocco.  <br>We were impressed on how clean and modern the city looked.  First, we drove to the Chellah Necropolis.   An impressive looking fortress, built on top of the ancient Roman town of Sala.  Surrounded by an ancient wall, it was built in the 14th century by Abu l-Hasanm,  a Merinid sultan.   The site includes the ruins of a mosque, a zawiya, and royal tombs, including that of Abu l-Hasan himself.  Today, the ruins of the minaret is a home to storks, and there are still some nice gardens and interesting places to explore.  Well work a visit if you are in Rabat.<br>Afterward, we went along the river to the Hassan Tower and the Mohammed V Mausoleum.  As you enter the courtyard which contains the Hassan Tower, you are greeted by ceremonial horse guards, uniformed in bright red, they are the ceremonial guards of the Kings Tomb.   The Hassan Tower is a minaret built in the 12th century for a mosque which was never finished.  A huge courtyard with hundreds of columns show where the mosque was planned.  Standing next to the tower you have a wonderful view of the sea, and the main cities of Rabat and Sale.  Turning away from the sea, you  see the  Mosque and Mausoleum of Mohammed V, the grandfather of the present day king of Morocco.  A beautiful site, which richly dressed ceremonial guards at each entrance.  Inside you looked down at the casket where Mohammed V lies in state.  An important monument to the nation of Morocco. Next we went to the old medina of Rabat.  A medina is the old section of the city, and usually contains the shopping district. Finally we wandered around the Kasbah of the Udayas, a  UNESCO world heritage site.  <br>In Casablanca, we wondered many parts of the city, including a visit to the Grand Mosque, the seashore, and both the old and new medina.We indeed plan on returning to visit more of this incredibaly facinating country.",393
4,8018,"Laos, a mysterious land in southeastern Asia, was the destination we found ourselves during Christmas 2002.  Why Laos?  Because we have never been there, and it is an interesting place which few westerners visit.   On our trip we flew from Osaka Japan, where we lived at the time, to Singapore.  After a couple of days in Singapore  we took a plane to Phnom Penh, Cambodia then on to Vientiane, Laos.  We flew Lao Aviation, which was quite an experience.  While it was a small plane, it was one of the few flights we have ever taken where no safety announcement was given.  Don't worry about the seat belts, and of course if there is a problem, every person for themselves (just kidding).<br>After a brief stop in a small town in southern Laos, we landed safely and smoothly at our destination in Vientiane.    Vientiane is a typical southeastern Asian city, which sits squarely on the banks of the mighty Mekong River.  Although there are remnants of French colonialism, few signs of western civilization are evident in this city which makes it truly a remote and exotic place to visit.   In Vientiane we wandered much of the downtown area with its city square and several parks on the the river.  In addition, we visited many of the sites including That Luang, the royal Stupa, Vat Phra Kero and Vat Sisaket, Buddhist temples.   A stupa is a Buddhist monument which traditionally contains relics of Buddha.  More  <br>Laos is a Buddhist nation.  It is the national religion and evidence of this is everywhere.  In fact, they have a long history of being radically Buddhist and of persecuting Christians for their faith (even today), something we didn't find out until after our trip. <br>After spending a couple of days wandering the capital city, we took a short flight up to Luang Prabang, a designated World Heritage Site, which is probably the top tourist destination in Laos.  Luang Prabang is located on both the Mekong and Khan Rivers and is very different from Vientiane.  It was much more Asian as compared to the French Colonial feel in Vientaine. This is due to the high density of Buddhist temples and the orange robed monks which could been seen everywhere.  Luang Prabang is the location of a major school for Buddhist monks.  During our time in Luang Prabang we visited many of the temple sites as well as the Royal Palace Museum, which had some very interesting history of the royal family in Laos. Also, we took a long boat up the Mekong to visit the Pak Ou caves.  This is a cave on the banks of the river which contains thousands of Buddha statues, and is only mildly interesting.  After visiting the caves, we crossed the river and visited the village of Pak Oh, where we ate lunch and wandered around the village.

Our first glimpse of Corsica revealed a rugged island, with jagged craggy mountains and snow capped peaks.  Yes, snow, even in July, snow could be seen in the uppermost mountains.  Calvi, Corsica was one of the ports we stopped at during a sailing trip on the Star Clipper from Cannes, France to Dubrovnik, Croatia in July of 2006. <br>Approaching Calvi, your eyes are immediately drawn to the most dominant feature in the town -  the citadel.   The citadel is a walled portion of the town which juts into the bay creating a very medieval look to the town.   Legend says that Christopher Columbus was born in Calvi (although most historians disagree) as can be seen in a monument at the approach to the citadel in town.   <br>We anchored in the harbor, and before we decided to go into town, Michael went Scuba Diving off of the walls of the citadel  where the remains of an American B17 bomber lies about 85-90 feet (25-28 meters) below the surface.  The bomber was mostly intact except for it's tail section.  In 1944, the B17 G ""Baron"" was on a mission in Italy. Unfortunately, German fighters hit the Baron. Without any radio, the pilot, Frank Chaplick, flew to Calvi (Corsica, France). The landing strip was too short, so he decided to land on the sea. <br>At lunch time, we took the tender into Calvi.  Starting off the afternoon, we ate a marvelous lunch in one of the many restaurants situated on the marina.  The marina, is a palm lined harbor on the waterfront with hoards of umbrella covered restaurant tables which of course feature French and Italian food, but with a Mediterranean flare.  After lunch we set off to explore the town. <br>We wandered the lower part of the town, looking through shops, parks and the like before deciding to set our sites upward.   To explore the citadel, we entered by way of Place Cristophe Colomb, named of course for that intrepid explorer.  It was hot, but we continued to wind our way around the walls taking in many of the breathtaking views of the town and harbor.  This was made much more fun in that the town within the citadel walls is not filled with tourist shops.  In fact you can only find a few shops and restaurants in the citadel.  The rest of the buildings include homes, the Governor's Palace, a couple of churches and loads of narrow, winding, empty streets.   We were amazed to find that the old town was peaceful and quiet, even in July, the height of tourist season.  At the top of the citadel you will find the Cathedral Saint-Jean Baptiste, a 13th century church (destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1570) where you can rest and pray for a few moments before descending back to the town. <br>After some wandering and shopping, we returned to the ship, having spent a peaceful day (although it was quite hot) in a sleepy little town called Calvi.  We would love to return to Corsica and explore it someday.  Perhaps it will be sooner than we think since some of our good friends are from Corsica and often spend summers back in their homeland.",251
6,8018,"St Lucia is one of our favorite islands in the Caribbean.  The beautiful rugged landscape is dotted with green rainforest, cascading waterfalls, quaint villages. and small sandy beaches.  The atmosphere is laid back and the people friendly people seem to ooze with that Caribbean charm.  In fact a typical saying on the island is ""no pressure, no problem"", a motto they seem to relish to the full.   Belinda and I have been to St Lucia 3 times, once staying a week at a Sandals resort, and twice again aboard the Royal Clipper anchoring at Rodney Bay, Marigot Bay and Soufriere.  <br>Our first trip, was in February 2005, and it was the first time we decided to take a ""winter vacation"" since we lived in Pennsylvania.  However, a few days before we were to leave, Belinda fell down the basement stairs and fractured both her ankles.  But not to be detoured, she insisted we come, even on crutches and air-casts on both legs.  However, we did enjoy the warm weather and beautiful beach.  We stayed at Sandals Regency La Toc, a beautiful all inclusive resort.  which essentially was an all inclusive, and unfortunately didn't go far because of Belinda's legs.  Michael sent scuba diving at various locations around St. Lucia, including between the two Pitons.  All in all, these winter vacations will become a habit.<br>The second trip was aboard the Royal Clipper, the largest ship in the Star Clippers fleet, a where we docked in Rodney Bay.  This was during our Windward Island sail in February 2008.  During this stopover, we went horseback riding of Cap Point.  The ride was both inland and on the beach.  We enjoy horseback riding and always try and ride when we have a chance.  It was a beautiful ride on a beautiful island.<br>On the third trip, in February 2009, we again were aboard the Royal Clipper, but this time we anchored more along the southern part of the island.  We spent the morning at Marigot bay, which is a beautiful small inlet, a marina, a small store and shopping area, and a group of beautiful villas and apartments dotting the hillside.  We really liked the area.  In the afternoon, we sailed south, anchoring off the village of Soufriere, practically in the shadow of Petit Piton.  The Pitons are a World Heritage area, which are the typical postcard image of the island.  Belinda took a trip inland, visiting some beautiful areas and gardens including the Soufriere volcanic area, and various waterfalls.  Michael wandered the town, and we caught up with each other in the late afternoon.<br>With the overall beauty, charm and Caribbean people, we love the ""no pressure, no problem"" attitude of this island paradise.",212
0,14937,"My ship, the MV Houston, brought containerized supplies to Ascension Island in August 2014. We loaded the containers in Port Canaveral, Florida. The majority of the containers were from Patrick AFB nearby in Florida. The goods were mostly supplies for the US Air Force base on the island (items for their commissary and exchange, as well as individuals\' personal effects). There were some commercial containers as well.
   Ascension Island doesn\'t have a dock for cargo or ocean going ships. We anchored a mile or so off of Georgetown and motorized barges came alongside during daylight hours and our ship\'s cranes discharged two containers onto each barge. Ascension Island had experienced a large storm right before we arrived so there was a large ocean swell that made the discharge more challenging and dangerous.
   After receiving its quota of 2 boxes the barge would go to the shore where a shore-based crane would lift the boxes off the barge and put them on a truck to bring them to their destination. Later after the containers were emptied of their contents they were brought back to the ship for return to the US.",221
1,14937,"  My wife and I were in Ceara for an 8 day/7night trip from Sao Paulo. We stayed at the Mareiro Hotel in the middle of the Beira Mar section of Fortaleza. The Mareiro isn't the most luxurious hotel in the area, but is comfortable and reasonably priced. The daily 'cafe de manha' (breakfast) buffet at the hotel is wonderful, with fresh fruits, juices, breads, omelettes, etc. The hotel is centrally located, within easy walking distance of many nice restaurants and shops. Every evening the beach sidewalk turns into a street-market type venue, with kiosks erected, offering locally made souvenirs such as T-shirts, wood carvings and other handi-crafts, leather goods, cashews,etc.<br>  We took several day-trips via tour bus to other nearby locales, namely Cumbuco, Morro Branco and Canoa Quebrada. The high-light of many of the beach areas are (at extra cost) dune buggy rides over the sand dunes and along the beaches (local drivers are mandatory). Jangadas (flat-bottomed sailing boats used by the locals for fishing) rides are also offered for rental.<br>  Cumbuco's buggy rides were the most thrilling and adventurous, with steep ascents and descents. In the middle of the ride we stopped at a ""Ski-bunda"" hill, where you slide down a steep hill, sitting on a waxed wooden board, hoping to glide all the way down the dune into a refreshing fresh-water lagoon. Falling off (until you get the hang of it) is half the fun. Cumbuco Beach is also well known by kite-boarders for its perfect combinaton of wind and wave conditons, in fact international tournaments are held here annually.<br>  The Morro Branco area is known for its beautifully colored sand and an area known as ""Labirinto das Falesias"" and is frequently used as a picturesque setting in Brazilian novellas and movies. Erosion over the years has carved a fascinating curving path from the dunes down to the beach, through the colorful sand. Once you reach the beach you climb onto your buggy for a ride along the surf.<br>  Canoa Quebrada is also another beautful beach area with interesting dunes and sand colors. Dune buggies also bring you down steep hills in this area.<br>  The excursions are reasonably priced and the restaurants and refreshments offered are also surprisingly fairly priced.<br>  Another area we wanted to visit is Jericoacoara but it was a 6 hr transit (each way) from Fortaleza. It has spectacular scenery as well (imagine Moab land formations located at the beach). It would be best to spend at least 3-4 days there so you don't waste (literally) half the day driving back and forth. Perhaps next time.",580

0,22488,"<p>Hey Dude [to a friend from Toronto who inquired&nbsp;about Bangladesh], I visited Toronto once and drove the entire 7 hours from Connecticut along the Erie Canal(nothing eerie about it!). I passed the world&rsquo;s one and only Beechnut Baby Food factory, spent the night in rusting Buffalo, and saw the fantastic Niagara Falls(they really cleaned up the place since my last visit in the 80s). Toronto is a world class city with lots of great architecture nicely situated along the water with a great ethnic mix... it&#39;s a refreshing change from the conservative suburbs of Connecticut. I summited the Toronto Tower but even at some 140 stories up there just wasn&#39;t much to see besides the vast tundra and piles of moose droppings. Bangladesh is a whole nother story. I originally visited Bangladesh since Bimar Air was the cheapest round trip to Rangoon, Burma from Bangkok($200). After visiting Burma (which should be near the top of your list if you haven&#39;t already been) I remember being relieved to be back in civilization upon landing in Dhaka. Can you imagine happy and relieved to be in Bangladesh of all places! Just gives you an idea of what a dysfunctional country Burma is... a textbook lesson in how to run a market economy into the ground with a team of crackpot astrological/economic psychics/advisers! There&#39;s nothing special to see in Dhaka except really bad traffic congestion with rickshaws and oxen challenging overloaded trucks and crazy taxi drivers for the right of way. It&#39;s a Muslim place so don&#39;t wear high heals or a miniskirt and you&rsquo;ll probably be the only tourist within sight. What is special about Bangladesh and Burma for that matter is that the locals haven&#39;t been corrupted by the tourist dollar yet and seem so innocent and genuinely sincere you wonder if money really is the root of all evil. I had a young, poor boy lead me to the ferry landing without any sort of expectation of payment whereas in India he would have harassed me for money. I thought about giving him a tip but then realized that it would corrupt the little lad and that by the time you showed up he would be asking for big bucks(now how about a little kickback for my valiant effort). I took the train to Chittagong but got homesick for Dhaka and didn&#39;t even bother to check out the beach. When I arrived at the Chittagong train station as the only tourist on the train, a Bangladeshi man, somewhat perplexed, asked me why I had bothered to visit Chittagong! If you do go avoid the pedestrian overpass, it&rsquo;s really a public bathroom and you&rsquo;ll have to tip toe past the piles of human dung-&nbsp;made me want to spell Chittagong with a capital &ldquo;S&rdquo;. Go to Bangladesh to say you were in Bangladesh or to hunt for the Bengal tiger, otherwise India&#39;s got everything and more!&nbsp;</p>

Keep several single dollar bills to pay as you go because everyone takes US Dollars. There&rsquo;s also high inflation so your guide book will be off by alot. Always bargain! Taxis are falling apart.

Two lines were pulling out fast so I grabbed one, Keone the other and we started reeling them in while Hoku&#39;s brother steered the boat parallel with the lines. It wasn&#39;t much of a fight as I drew to the end of my line and spotted a long Ono dangling on the hook. Keone pulled the fish onboard and whacked it on the head with an aluminum bat while I grabbed his line and reeled in the other Ono.

6,22488,"<p>Where In the World? Tuesday, July 17, 2012 Partly named after an indigenous cactus, this British overseas territory has jet-setters flocking hither to enjoy one of the finest beaches in all the West Indies and world class diving on coral reefs reaching depths of more than 7,000 feet. Before the jets and as recently as the first hotel opening in 1968, many of the &quot;belongers&rdquo;&nbsp;traced their arrival back to a Spanish slave ship that wrecked ashore in 1844. Traffic was virtually non existent, there being only three vehicles on the island, one of them a bulldozer. It was in one of these other vehicles that Suzie, a newly transplanted hotel manager from New York, would pick up guests from the airport, lining up her headlights with the runway to facilitate approach during night time landings. Today as you make your way into town you might spot a street named &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;&nbsp;and you might just wonder about Suzie and about days long since departed. This extended weekend, in part celebration of the birth of the much beloved Anja Regina and part escape from New York&#39;s urban inferno, I will file this country, this &quot;magic monotony of existence between sky and water&quot; where &quot;aging is optional&rdquo;, #80 under &quot;T&rdquo;&nbsp;between Turkey and Uruguay. - A few days later - By the time you read this I will be high and dry some 30,000 feet over the Bahamas enroute to Atlanta with the fine white powdery beaches of the Providenciales fading quickly in the turquoise waters. It was early Sunday morning when I made my way to the remote and secluded North West Point passing locals dressed in their finest on the way to church services, the tourists still bedridden, recovering from a bout of rum poisoning the night before. I drove several miles along a desolate, rocky dirt road past shrubs and salt ponds over the highest hill until finally reaching Malcom beach. It was here in this bay that Christopher Columbus set anchor and explored the area many, many years ago. I thought I had the entire beach park to myself but spotted a flurry of activity further down near the exclusive Amanyara Resort. Upon closer inspection I found out it&rsquo;s a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret swimsuit photo shoot(they also shot here the year before). I made my into the water to find what other wonderful surprises the reefs might offer. The waters were teaming with fish, and I spotted a Barracuda, with a nice set of sharp teeth, just 10 feet away. As in Hawaii there are public access ways to all the beaches even among the big resorts, however being a British Overseas Territory, the beach up to the high water mark is not owned by the people but rather by, ahem, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. I found &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;, she now has an entire shopping plaza named after her, and made my way down to the marina where the original hotel, the Turtle Cove Inn, is still accepting guests. Gentle turquoise waters, friendly English speaking locals, reefs full of a diverse aquatic life, and powdery white beaches as soft as cotton candy teaming with supermodels, the Turks and Caicos certainly is &ldquo;beautiful by nature&quot;.</p>

I met the hotel owner who lived in Queens and San Antonio for 10 years before his visa expired. Skopje is divided by the Varda river into the Christian south and the Turkish/Ottoman north both of which suffered greatly after the 1963 earthquake.</p>

11,22488,"<p>Dublin - September 20th, 2012 - Dia Dhuit(or &ldquo;Hello&quot; as they say in Irish), We landed in the cool pitch blackness of Ireland at 4:45 am this morning and I caught the 6am bus for the thirty minute ride to the historic Dublin city center and checked into the hostel where a bunch of German and French tourists were busy eating breakfast. I only got an hour of sleep on the short 5 hour flight over (much faster the than 8 week journey Irish immigrants took to America during the potato famine) and the excitement of exploring a new city is keeping me awake for now. The sun is peaking through the clouds which is always a welcome sight in otherwise rainy Ireland. Dublin is small and compact and easy to get around on foot and I hope to see all the historic sights in time for my Sunday departure to Lisbon, Portugal. We took off yesterday evening from JFK on Aer Lingus, Ireland&rsquo;s national airline. It was my first time flying an aero-plane and they&#39;re pretty much all alike except this one was all green inside. The flight attendant greeted us and then proceeded with a live demonstration on the intricacies of seat belt mechanics. She then said something in a foreign tongue which sounded a lot like Norwegian mixed with Dutch and a little Danish but was in fact Irish, or Gaelic for you lingual purists, and I swear I saw a leprechaun dart out from one of the overhead bins. I checked into the Four Courts Hostel, which was located in the old medieval city center that was first settled by the Vikings back in 841 A.D., and proceeded into the streets in search of a full Irish breakfast complete with black and white pudding and a rasher of bacon despite having only managed one hours sleep on the flight over. They say it rains here twice a week, once for 3 days and then again for 4 days but during my entire three day stay in Dublin it only managed to rain a mere 5 minutes, a stray rain cloud. I must of had the luck of the Irish because the radio DJ was thanking everyone for sending in pictures of the sunset and dare I say I actually got a nice tan. Dublin is a modern, compact, and walkable city with only one skyscraper which they plan to tear down soon. The people are cheery and friendly and I can barley make out their Irish accent. I took in all the major sites with the help of the hop-on-hop-off open double decker tourist bus, crossed the O&#39;Connel bridge, wider than it is long, walked through Phoenix Park, Europe&#39;s largest city park - twice the size of Central Park, saw the worlds tallest sculpture, 400 feet high - locally known as the rod to God, eaten steak and Guinness pie, strolled the grounds of Trinity College, gazed at the spire of St.Patricks Cathedral, and heard the lyrics of traditional Irish music.</p>

I took a bus to the Suez Canal and saw the super tankers pass by with all the crew on the rails gawking at us and getting ready for the pirate attacks. Cairo is so big and full of stuff I decided to spend the whole week here and see the rest of the country later. They have restaurants that specialize in mean bowls of macaroni for one buck. The pastries are really good, sweet sticky honey nuts and crunch and I got a whole plate full for 5 bucks. Two scoops of gellato will set you back $0.75. A taxi across town in a 1960 matchbox Fiat with missing door handle will set you back $2. I rode a camel to the Giza pyramids which are massive mountains of stone slowly crumbling to dust. Everybody is mad at the Israeli bombings and the guy who threw his shoes at Bush is a hero. I took the subway for twenty cents and the first two cars are for females only. They have Hardees and Radio Shack here too. Most people speak broken English so I only need to use my Arabic in 60 seconds to impress. I visited the Sultan Hassan Mosque in old Cairo which is huge and was built in 1325, shortly thereafter one of the two minarets crumbled taking 300 people down with it. Everybody here wishes you a &ldquo;Happy New Year and a Merry Christmas&rdquo; because the Coptic Christians don&#39;t celebrate Christmas until January 6th.</p>

Belize used to be British Honduras and only became independent in 1981. The British brought in people from the four corners of their empire, Indians, Chinese, Lebanese and a contingent of German Mennonites who left Canada in 1957 because the government mandated that their kids go to public school. Every little town has two or three Chinese restaurants and the shops sell English meat pies and sometimes they give change in US dollars. I have satellite TV in my room with so many USA channels including C-Span, the Weather Channel, 4 Indian and 4 Chinese channels. Tomorrow I take a short ferry ride to Livingston, Guatemala and then on to the Bay Islands of Honduras continuing on south on to the next Banana Republic.

One penny-pinching British tourist asked me if it was worth the $15 and I told him it cost me well over $100 when I visited the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. I&#39;m in Goa, a former Portugese enclave on the west coast. A lot of working class British package tourists fly in for the Christmas Holidays and get rip-roaring drunk.

5,3533,"Tromelin is the smallest of the 4 Scattered Islands I visited.  It is anoval shaped island about 1600 meters (one mile) long and 700 meters(less than half a mile) wide.  It is covered by many low attrative bushesthat the boobies like to nest in.  At the highest end - only 7 meters -is a weather station, a substantial concrete building designed towithstand cyclones which typically hit the island every 3 years.  Thereare 40 or 50 coconut trees around the weather station.  These are theonly trees on the island.There were 6 or 7 people living here: a few weathermen and a fewnaturalists studying birds and turtles.  Unlike the other scattered French islands in the Indian Ocean there is no military presence.The other major features of the island is that it is shaped like asaucer with a depression in the middle so you have an unobstructed viewacross the island as you walk the path that circumnavigates it.  Thelanding strip fits perfectly lengthwise on the island.Finally, there is no reef or lagoon so the waves come crashing into theisland.  It is dangerous to swim because sharks can come almost to theshore.  Basically, the island is a coral reef above the ocean so all yousee is coral and some sand.  Half of the beach is rocky.The main attraction on the island are 2 species of boobies: thered-footed boobie and the masked boobie.  They are fairly comfortablewith people so you can come within 10 meters.  There are some otherbirds as well.The total number of turtle tracks is about 4,000 a year and the peak dayis about 20.  This was surprising to me because of limited sand beaches.In contrast, the Glorioso Islands have superb sand beachs for turtles.Since a female turtle can lay eggs every 12 days for 3 to 7 times.  Thismeans that less than 1000 turtles a year visit Tromlein.The French eradicated the rats in 2005, but there are still some mice.At the weather station there are hundreds and hundreds of hermit crabs.Frequently, one crab will do a take down move on another crab thatusually defends itself successfully for the 5 minutes of the attack, butit can end in canabalism.In the Wikipedia article on Tromelin, one can read the story of theshipwreched slaves in 1761.  We viewed the anchor of the ship at lowtide and 5 of the cannons are still on the beach after all these years!!The journalists on board waded into the ocean to see the other 8 cannonsjust 4 meters off the beach.All of the tourists enjoyed our one day stay on Tromelin and boarded thehelicopter at the end of the day in our usual fashion to return to the Marion Dufresne.Since there is no Gendarme on the island, the ships doctor stamped all ofour passports.",469

Not because I love to gamble, but because I have so many memories of being there (starting when I was a girl and going to Kidsquest). In fact, for my 21st birthday, I spent it at the Grand Casino in Gulfport. That casino actually doesn&apos;t exist anymore...Hurricane Katrina destroyed it.

And one of the highest ranked basketball teams, the Hornets! And even if we don&apos;t win any Superbowls (or barely any playoff games for that matter), you still have to love our Saints.

by Gene (Terry) Johnson - 4 months ago

My wife and I are staying in the centrally located Brunei Hotel.  Its a 4 star, renovated and comfortable, with a nice buffet breakfast.  Its a block N of the bus station which we have used each day; #36 to Tasek Lama Park, #39 to the Brunei Museum (under renovation), then walked 1 mile to the Maritime & Technology Museums, and #20 to the Mall/Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque.  They are medium sized buses with AC and cost 1B$ each.

Our high points were;

-meeting Mark Putera Delima and his wife Wann, markputeradelima@gmail.com They provide tours and the one we took was up the Brunei River to specifically see the endemic and endangered Proboscis Monkeys.  We were able to observe 2 families of 10+ each up in the mangrove trees foraging and interacting for over 1 hour.  Just an incredible experience, just like being with the Lowland Gorillas in DR of Congo and the Chimps along Lake Tanganika.  Besides, we photographed a Salt Water Crocodile, Gold-ringed Cat Snake, 2 Rufous Night Herons, and many water birds.  Mark is a naturalist guide and his wife is an excellent communicator speaking good English.

-walking to all the city center sights to include Regalia Museum, the new Mall (4 blocks west near the pier) with a large supermarket in the basement, and discovering Babu's Kitchen clean with AC and inexpensive Asian food.

The BWN airport was a quick 1B$ ea to our hotel and the hotel van provides the return transfer.

This is our 215th TCC country and our first story!  Gene and Terry Johnson, Dec 10, 2015.",483
0,26409,"<p>Just returned from a two day excursion to Somaliland. &nbsp;This was part of a longer tour of the Horn of Africa. &nbsp;Somaliland is a self governing area comprising the former, British Somaliland. &nbsp;It was given independence by Britain, but shortly thereafter made a huge mistake by agreeing to join Somalia (former Italian Somalia). &nbsp;A subsequent break away war with Somalia led to a self contained and self governing entity, while Somalia devolved into &ldquo;failed state status&rdquo;. &nbsp;Unfortunately, no other nations recognize Somaliland independence. &nbsp;Hence, no international banking, no international postal union and not much international internet service.</p>

<p>The capital, Hargeysa, is a dusty, ramshackle. &nbsp;Nothing of significant interest beyond some interesting foods and a very hospitable populace. &nbsp;Although there has been no violence in many years (a remote bombing several years ago) we were required by regulation to be escorted by 3 AK-7 armed police officers everywhere we travelled. &nbsp;They were professional, friendly and helped immensely with city traffic control and navigating check points outside of Hargeysa.</p>

<p>The real highlight of the tour was the day long visit to Laas Geel Caves. &nbsp;This Neolithic site contains rock art dating back 5,000-11,000 BC. &nbsp;The scenes of people and animals (including giraffes) were in pristine condition. &nbsp;The paint (made from plants and rocks) was vivid. &nbsp;We visited about 9 separate sites (there are more). &nbsp;We were told that, although known to local nomads, it was not until 2002 that French archeologists &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; these magnificent caves. &nbsp;While visiting, we were told that only about 200 tourists a year visit this site. &nbsp;Indeed a great and rare privilege. &nbsp;Highly recommended. &nbsp;Easily combined with visits to Ethiopia and Sudan.</p>

The resort itself was fantastic - crystal water, amazing facilities, pool bars, a night club, shopping areas, and great restaurants. However, after I grew tired of the same resort day-after-day (and the sight of hung-over teenagers), I needed a getaway. Travel for me is not staying in the same resort for a week - you need to experience the country you are visiting. So, one of the days I went to a dolphin facility to swim with dolphins, which was pretty cool. A few days later I left again to see the Coba Mayan Temple (we orginally wanted to go to Chichen Itza, but since you can no longer climb the steps of the temple, we went to Coba instead, and it was fantastic!!), the tallest temple in the Yucatan Peninsula.

Neither of us had ever been to Chicago, so we were very excited.  We drove from St. Louis on a beautiful autumn Friday.  We had heard so much about Chicago both good and bad that we were both excited and apprehensive.  Let me tell you we had the best time.  The concert was off the chain.  Tina Turner puts younger women to shame with her energy and talent.  But Chicago was so much fun for us.  When didn&apos;t get to do a lot, but we managed to go to the Navy Pier and walk around.  At the entrance to the Pier, we saw a statue of a man in a chair that caught our eye.  When we  got closer, we realized it was a statue of Dr. Bob Hartly from the Bob Newhart Show, when he played a psychiatrist.  There was a couch right next to it for you to sit and act like you were a patient.  It was pretty cool. We then took an architectural bus tour through downtown Chicago.  The buildings were absolutely beautiful and the stories behind them were told in an appealing manner by the tour guide.  I only knew about the Sears building before my visit, during the visit I learned that the Hancock Building was actually taller than the Sears Building.  There was also a building whose design was inspired by an open pack of cigarettes and when you looked at it you could totally see why. We went to the Weber Grill for lunch.  The service and the food was excellent and the prices were not unreasonable.  If I had to pick one negative thing about our visit it was the price of parking.

1,2701,"Going out in Reykjavik is some thing special, it’s an area of less then a mile long right in the center of town, off a main road with smaller roads turning off of it to the right and left with about a hundred of bars, cafes, and restaurants that turn into dancing and drinking places. People go out late here, maybe around midnight and most places stay open till 6am or so, before going out most Icelandic people start drinking at home, or they go to home parties because alcohol is so expensive here and they want to be some what drunk before reaching the center. Most Icelandic young people 16 to 25 drink to get drunk when they go out on Fridays and Saturdays the rest of the week the center is some what busy but not like on weekends when the madness happens. There are lines to get into most of the good places and it’s good to be a VIP here if you don’t like waiting on lines but no cover charge and there is no smoking inside all of these places which is a good thing. There is a lot of drinking on the street from bottles or glasses and there is a lot of broken glass every where. As I said before when the Icelandic’s drink to get drunk they become quite aggressive unlike during the week when they don’t drink and are very reserved and there are many fights here with the police getting involved and always some one is bleeding and the women I feel spit more then the men here, walking around the street drunk with a bottle of beer and spiting, I saw that over and over again. The women are pretty here but there are also a lot of over weight girls here. The women kind of act like men, they don’t hold back, once they are drunk they aggressively try to pick up the man they are interested in. So this is what my weekends are like, I walk around sometimes alone most times with some friends I have met here and go from place to place checking things out, dancing and trying to see in which place are the most prettiest women at. Each place has its own type of cliental whether older people or rockers or yuppies and so on. So that is night life on weekends in Reykjavik. <br>I decided to also visit Greenland, I have to pick where I want to go in Greenland because you can’t get around by car there, it’s only by air or by ship and very expensive, so I have decided to fly to Nuuk the capital city. So during the past week I was looking into air tickets to get there and I found a flight that just started this week from Reykjavik to Nuuk from the main airport in Iceland named Keflavik the best price I could find for that flight was $730 round trip, so I took it, also at the same time I visited the local attractions with in an hour’s time from Reykjavik the capital. Such as Kleifarvatn which is a lake area with geysers in a mountain area, some light houses on the cost line, a bridge that connects the fault line between North America and Europe and last the famous Blue Lagoon nature hot bath which was quite green when I visited it, costing $30 to sit in some hot green water out doors but if you know me even a little, I would never pay that, maybe because I have two hot tubs at home or maybe because the water was green and it should have been blue like the name. What I would do is go inside threw the restaurant area to film it first and since I am all ready in, I might as well stay in, well that’s me.  <br><br>So on Sunday at 9:30am I drove from my place to a gas station filled up the tank and then headed to the hostel where the three Czech people were camping out, to pick them up for our journey around Iceland. I choose them because they were in their late 20’s and early 30’s, it looked like we could get along, and I could trust them and enjoy the trip with them. There was one couple and a single guy and they were friends, they were non smokers. Also they had tents and wanted to sleep out in the nature for free, and I could sleep in the tent with the single guy, he had an extra mat, so all I needed was a sleeping bag. Another reason I picked them was, they had cooking equipment and I could join them in the meals, also they wanted to be dropped of on day five at Myvatn which was three quarters of the way around Iceland but would give me their share of the gas money for the other two days for me to complete the whole circle around Iceland, what a deal for me. That’s why I picked them, now I was able to rent the car from a private person who I knew, he trusted me, and we became friends, for the whole week for $150 and actually if I came back sooner or needed the car longer the price would be the same. So as I started my trip I just made a profit of $150 in my pocket. Sounds like a Jesse story, right? So we packed the car up with their stuff, settled with money and were off. For the next 7 days I would be the only driver of the car, I drove 2,600 kilometers that's about 1,600 miles and the gas expense for the whole journey was 30,000ISK which is about $500 which we split four ways. Our day would start any time in the morning after we had breakfast and packed up the tents, I would try to keep on moving for at least 12 hours a day even if that meant that we stopped some place for a few hours. On the 1st day I drove out of Reykjavik the Capital to the Pingvallayatn lake, which is Iceland's largest natural lake where some car company was shooting a commercial with sharp looking cars and this beautiful lake was in the back ground, then onto Pingvellir National park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, known as the center of Icelandic culture started in 930 AD when the 1st general assembly came together for a formal government structure, Iceland has the oldest running government in Europe. Also this place is straddling two continents, it’s the fault line between America and Europe, and it lies within a belt of volcanic activity and has 2 small water falls. Then to Geysir which is a place were hot water is shooting out of the ground maybe 40 feet in the air every few minutes and the tourist are standing around it waiting to catch it with their cameras. Next to Gullfoss which was the largest water falls in Iceland really magnificent. Then to Kerio which is a Crater with water in it. The excursion to do this trip is known as the Golden circle and it cost 7,000 ISK about $115 and takes 10 hours. But I had to keep on going, I drove into a town named Selfoss which produces most of Iceland's milk and so we stopped to drink some.   <br>Then not to far from Kross to see the black sand beach's in the south west part of Iceland, here I had to park the car and walk through dunes more then an hour to get to the black sand and cost line. Next to Seljalandsfoss another breath taking water fall that you can see right off, from the road and that you can walk behind it. Now it was evening hours but still light out side and I was headed on a dirt road to the back of Eyjafjallajokull glacier when I drove up to water from a river crossing over the road, since I had a normal car and not a 4 by 4 I did not take the chance to cross the deep water, I parked there, off the road and we set up camp for the 1st night.<br> <br>On the second day around 9am as we were packing up and decided that we can’t go further into the area because of the rivers were preventing us from crossing, a woman was drooping off some people where we were parked, they also had a normal car and could not cross the water, so I asked her where was she heading too, she said that she was going all the way on the dirt road till the end about a 40 minute drive, I also wanted to know how many rivers there were to cross to get to the end she said about 25 and told me that my car would not make it there, so I asked her if she would take us there, I was not worried on how we would get back to the car, she said you have 2 minutes to decided if you are coming with me or not, so I ran back to the 3 Czech’s and told them, lets take the gamble and get the ride to the end of the road and worry about getting out later, they agreed and we all grabbed a few items and were off.  <br>She had a big 4 by 4 and told us about the area, and on the way she stopped to show us for 2 minutes Lonio which is a lagoon in front of the glacier with ice bergs in it melting away. Then she took us to Basar where there was one cabin and dropped us off, where the landscape is strikingly beautiful and the contrasts in color among the plant life, glaciers, wasteland and blue skies are great. I finally had my breakfast there and then after an hour or so there, we started to walk back to the car, no one would give us a lift, well there were only two excursion buses there, and when they heard four people they said no. So we started walking on the road through streams and rivers that crossed over the road and at one point I got my shoes wet so now when ever I reached another water crossing I just walked right into it, we stopped again at the lagoon with the ice bergs to take a second look at it. I was walking for three and a half hours, it was getting a bit hot, when I saw a miracle in the distance on the road, it was a car with two people trying to fix a flat tire, as I got closer I thought what a brake for me, I went up to them offered my help and then asked them for a drink of water, we got talking, I told them what they could see up the road, showed them it on my map, which they did not have and asked me where I got it, do you know where I am going with this? I asked them if they saw the green car parked when they came in, they were a French couple and the car was a Renault, so off course he saw it, so I asked him if he would give me and my three friends who were about 15 minutes behind me, a ride back to the car for my map, he started to think about it and it seamed to him like a good trade by this time the Czech’s arrived, the problem was now there were six of us, so he said he could only take two of us back, so I told him why don’t you leave your girlfriend her with your bags, you have to come back here any ways, the girl right away said no, and the others looked at me like he’s got balls, but after thinking about it for a few minutes she agreed, so I gave her my map, told her which path to walk to the lagoon and we left, he drove like a bat out of hell, it took us maybe 20 minutes or so to get back to the car but if we had to walk it would have taken another four hours at least to reach it. Once in the car there would be no more walking for me this day, it was driving time only, but the 3 Czech’s loved the hike, I could live with out it. Next it was to Skogafoss another water fall but this one you could walk on top of it and there was a second fall about a five minute walk further on. From this point on, while traveling on highway #1 it was possible to see in the distance a larger glacier on the left side named Myrdalsjokull and on the right side in the distance you could see the sea, by the way highway #1 circled Iceland. Then it was onto the town of Vik where there was a view from the top of the mountain of rocks shooting out of the sea, also this was the 1st refueling of gas for the car, we drove 394 kilometers about 250 miles and it cost 4,600 ISK about $75. The exchange rate was about $1 = 62 ISK. Once again it was reaching evening hours as we reached the largest glacier in Iceland, named Vatnajokul and this one was very easy to see from the road, now we entered Skaftafell National Park where you could stand right next to the glacier and feel the cold temperature from it. Then it was a short ride to Jokulsarlon lagoon one of the most stunning things I saw on this trip, here scenes in two James Bond movies were filmed, it was a lagoon with 100s of ice bergs some standing still and others floating out of the lagoon into the sea under a bridge that connects the highway and you could spot seals swimming around, the weather here was freezing cold and windy. This was a place that we decided we wanted to see what it looked like in the morning but it was to cold there to set up the tent, and after my first night sleeping in the tent on the mat without a sleeping bag, I knew it would be too cold for me. I had blanket and a pillow that my Icelandic friend lent me, so I drove 20 kilometers from there and found a wormer place where we would camp for the night. I dropped them off there and they would get the camp in order, I needed to find a place that had electricity so I could charge up my battery for my video camera so I stopped at some hotel on the road and went to one of the buildings where there was a lobby area but no reception and started to recharge my battery’s, there also was a TV there, so I turned it on and watched some TV. Here I would hit the jackpot. The hotel was kind enough to provide me with a brand new comforter thick blanket which I thought would be great to put over the mat but under me to make my sleep softer and more comfortable to sleep on. I worked out a great price with the hotel for it. Once my batteries were charged I left and headed back to our camp site. They were already in the tents, so I made my bed and put my new blanket over the mat and felt like I was at the Hilton Hotel. My tent mate was amazed that I was able to solve all of my travel problems, as easily as they occurred. <br>On day three, well that I will save for next time.<br><br>On day three I woke up in the Hilton Hotel, well that is how I felt, I had a great night sleep and I had a big smile on my face, it was just so comfortable, warm, dry and peaceful. Since I was in charge of driving the others took care of setting up the tents, tearing down the tents, cooking the meals and washing the dishes. What an easy life I had. So after a short ride we were back at Jokulsarlon lagoon, the lagoon with 100s of icebergs that we visited from the night before. Here we walked around, took pictures and saw some seals swimming. There was a boat excursion that tourist could take for 30 minutes around the lagoon going between the icebergs and maybe closer to the seals it cost $40, but it’s not my thing, too many restrictions to be herded like cattle on and off the boat, and be in a carrel atmosphere with the other tourist, I mean real tourist you get off the tour bus to get onto the boat tour. The others wanted to do the boat trip the night before but thought it was too expensive this morning and decided not too. From here I drove to Hofn, which was the largest town on the south east cost and is known as a fishery town, so here we went to one of the fishing factories walked around it and then bought a kilo of Red fish for $9 all ready filleted, we thought it was a good buy and that it was cheap for Iceland, compared to a kilo of fillet chicken breast that cost $48, we were getting a steal of a deal, it would be our lunch later on in the day.  Here was the 2nd refueling of gas for the car, we drove 398 kilometers about 250 miles and it cost again 4,600 ISK about $75. From here the driving was in the direction of north east and we were besides the cost line to our right. On one side the beautiful cost line, sometimes cliffs, sometimes dunes, some sand beaches, rock formations in the water and on the other side cliffs, mountains with ice/snow or with out ice/snow, some more smaller water falls, grass and this purple flower which was every where in Iceland and known as their symbol flower, I would stop the car and get out for pictures along the way. By the way there were also sheep every where grazing as I drove around the island. All along this cost line the drive was passing the eastern fjords of Iceland we also saw some little port towns. We decide to camp at a town called Reyoarfjorour because this small town like many others offer a free camp site for campers with bathrooms and kitchen facilities, including hot water and sometimes a washing machine and a dryer, let me say it again, “for free” unbelievable what the Icelandic government and local towns do for the tourist industry in Iceland.<br><br>Day four, the 1st place that I was going to drive to was a harbor town but drove much further north of it, to a bird sanctuary in Borgarfjorour, for bird watching, I drove here by mistake that turned out to be a good one, here I saw the famous Icelandic Puffins, also Eiders, Gulls, Snipes and Oystercatchers just meters away from me on a cliff. Then it was on to that harbor town, but to get there I had to drive threw a very step road over this mountain that still had snow every where in June, at the top of the mountain you had a view of Seydisfjordur which was that harbor town, here you could take an over night ferry which cost more then taking a two hour airplane flight from the capital, I didn’t understand that one, once a week to Faeroe Islands, it’s north of Scotland but that is a future place I will visit some day. Before heading down to the town there was a beautiful water fall and great views of the town and of the fjord that it sits in. After walking around town and having lunch, this was the 3rd refueling of gas for the car I drove 483 kilometers about 300 miles and cost 5,200 ISK about $85. Next it was on to a forest area which was west in land, here was the 1st time you could see lots of trees, millions of flowers and it was green every where. From there we headed over some mountains deeper inland over landscape that was boring, to a controversial Dam that was being built at the time in the middle of no where and destroying the nature. I noticed that there was only one way in, which meant we would have to back track about 2 hours back to the forest area to get out, but then I noticed on the posted map that they have next to every attraction/point of interest that there was a dirt road out over the other side of the Dam, however it was off limits and restricted only to vehicles from the company who were building the dam, so after negotiating with my fellow passengers, two of us decided to take the chance, my front passenger who was my navigator and I said lets go for it, the two in the back were freaking out. All the workers, mostly Orientals were looking at us; I drove as if we were on our way to work as we reached half way on the dam a security truck drove up to me and asked me, do you work here? I said off course and I need to get to the other side, he asked me again and my answer was the same, he asked me to follow him and as we reached the other side of the dam he said you don’t work here, I said no I don’t but I need to get out of here from this side, he said there are no roads out of here only a dirt way and in many places water ran over it, I said I’ll take my chances  and he showed me the main dirt way out of there, for the next 3 hours I was driving less then 10 miles an hour not knowing where I was going it was after 10pm but at the end I made it, it always works out for me and we were out of the wasteland area on our way to find a place to pitch the tents near this large water fall that we would visit first thing tomorrow. <br> <br>On the fifth day, we woke up at the site of the water fall called Dettifoss. Which was the largest fall of a network of four falls, here I also so the falls called Hafragilsfoss. By noon and 25 km to the north we were on our way to Asbyrgi Canyon which is in Jokulsargljufur National Park, here in the canyon you can see plants, birds and rocks there was a pond, and lots of woods. Next it was a drive along the northern cost line to get to Husavikur, there where many pit stops on the way for great pictures of the drops to the cost line. Husavikur which is a port town with a wharf on the north cost line of Iceland is known for the best place to go by boat whale watching. It was a nice little tourist town, here was the 4th refueling of gas for the car, we drove 393 kilometers about 250 miles and it cost again 4,600 ISK about $75. From here I was on my way to Myvatn Lake and its surrounding attractions, once getting there I would stay there for the night and explore all the beautiful and unique things you could see there. Like Lake Myvatn one of the largest lakes in Iceland, Myvatn Nature Baths, Hverfjall mountain crater 140 meters in depth and 1000 meters in circumference, one of the largest on the planet, Dimmuborgir is a vast area of lave formation rocks, Skutustaoagigar craters are pseudocraters formed in a steam explosion when molten lava rushed over wetlands, Hverir an area with bubbling mud pits, Namafjall mountain is a high temperature area with sulfur springs and steam vents, Krafla is another crater but with water inside it, Leirhnjukur mountain is an area with hot springs and lava formations, Grjotagja are caves with hot springs inside them, the good thing about all of these attractions is that they are very near each other at the most 30 minutes by car from the furthest one to the other side. So here I stayed the fifth night and the sixth day and after running from place to place, walking around and taking pictures, this was the place we settled with the final gas money, they would give me for not continuing the whole trip another $120, life is sweet, I said good bye and wished my Czech passengers a nice stay. They traveled with me for five days and 1,725 kilometers, they had planed this with me from the start, to get dropped off here because they wanted to stay there for a much longer period of time then I was planning. <br><br>So it was day six of travel and I was off on my own, finally, don’t get me wrong it was good traveling with the group but there is nothing like Jesse on he’s own, can’t beat that. <br>I was on my way to the next water fall that was on my path around the island, it was named Godafoss another beautiful fall, lots of them here in Iceland. Next it was to the City of Akureyri and you read it right I said city, it’s the second largest one in Iceland about 20,000 people and it’s located in the northern center of the island. After dinner I kept on going I headed across a road in the middle of no where only two or three meters over the water on the north cost and washed the sun set all alone, no cars no lights no people, then it was to a town called Blonduos a nice little town, here I found another free camping grounds with washing facility’s and decided to stay for the night, I slept in the car, I was able to put the front passenger sit all the way down and had a great night sleep there.<br><br>Day seven this is the day I planed to complete the circle and be back in the capital. I only had 420 kilometers left to get there and had the whole day in front of me. I started my day with a good breakfast in the car with cheese, bread, hearing, tomato, caviar spread and orange juice. Half way to the capital there was finally some points of interest on the road. First there was Baula crater which was only a five minute walk from where you parked your car, then there was this area called Reykholt which was a green valley area with a river passing threw it and mountains on both sides, here Icelandic people came to camp, play golf and just relax in nature. Then I was pleasantly surprised when I was driving out of that area and came across a wonderful waterfall, this was a different type of falls it had fifty or so falls flawing from behind bushes or from the landscape into the passing river, really a nice site. Then I was headed to the western cost line to the town of Borgarnes, there was a small island connected to the town, here I had my last refueling of gas for the car, I drove 742 kilometers about 460 miles since my last fill up and it cost 4,100 ISK about $65. The car was costing me less now that I had less weight in the car and I stuck to good roads. From here I drove along the western cost line passing threw the fjords to Reykjavik the capital, it only took me two hours to get there. So one week later and 2,600 kilometers of driving I was back where I started with more money in my pocket then the $550 I changed at the banks with in the first two weeks of being in Iceland. How did that happen? I unpacked the car headed to my friend’s apartment and put my dirty cloths in the washing machine, it was Saturday night and I was planning to go out dancing and do some drinking.   <br><br><br>",230
2,2701,"Well I am here in San Hose it’s the capital of Costa Rica. At the airport I changed some $$$ and got the good rate then I took a public bus into town (50 cents), on the bus I started to ask one guy some questions and I ended up renting a room from him at his house for $25 a week ... <br>Its great, a new house, the bad thing is its about 30 minutes by bus to the center of town but it only cost 25 cents to get there. If I go by taxi it cost $4. So when I go home late at night from they clubs and bars I will be using the more expensive means of transportation....<br>So far every thing is very cheap and I am starting to get to know the town...<br>If I find a better place I might move but his place is really nice and clean and safe, so that's it for now....<br>I have seen the Capital and it is not a tourist place, quite boring. <br>I am on my way to Limon it’s on the Caribbean cost of Costa Rica.<br>So where was I, I was leaving San hose to go to the Carnival in Limon, I will pick up from there.<br>Well I got side tracked and took a 2 hour bus to Cariari, there I changed to another bus for an hour ride and then to a boat ride for an hour through the canals that took me to Tortuguero which is a nation park where Turtles lay there eggs at night and is protected by the government. <br>I saw baby turtles running to the water at sunrise. I stayed there for 2 nights and then took a 4 hour boat ride through canals of the jungle to Limon which like I said before is on the Caribbean side of CR. When I got there the carnival was going to last for a whole week and I showed up on the 1st day so I decided to take off and return later on that week the 15Th of the month was suppose to be the best day for Carnival. So I went to Puerto Viejo about a 1 and half hour bus ride further south, stayed there for 3 nights lots of tourist there and lots of American students learning in CR. I got bored quick so I decided to take a trip into Panama. I went to a group of Islands called Bocas Del Toro; I stayed on 2 different islands there and for 3 nights then came back to CR again. Went to a small town called Cahuita and stayed for 4 nights it also had a national park, I used that town as a place to jump into Limon and see the Carnival. Today I am in a place called Fortuna its in the mountains in the central north west of CR and its where the only active Volcano in CR is I can see the smoke from my window.. <br>This afternoon I was hanging out in a waterfall...<br><br>To get to the waterfall I hitched hike a ride and an American guy who has lived here for 5 and a half years picked me up, he is 1 of those guys that lived in a communion in Hawaii has dread locks till his knees and now he lives in the jungle here with his woman, on some land they bought, well anyways he invited me to his place tomorrow and I went there. I stayed with him for 30 hours or so it was my 1st time in my life taking a shit out in the jungle, he gave me a shovel and some toilet paper and said dig a hole near 1 of his banana trees and take care of my business.. The shit looked different too because he is a vegetarian so for the last day that's all I eat... after that he took me back to La Fortuna and I stayed 1 more night.. Then to Santa Elena and Moteverde which is a cloud forest in the mountains it always was raining there, I stayed for 3 nights got there by hitch hiking again, 3 cars picked me up to the boat ride and then a mini van ride all for free, I have my ways. Here I went on a Canopy tour. That's flying on cables through the forest the longest was 600 meters long, there were 15 cables, also repelling down 10 meters and there was a Tarzan swing too, 12 meters down, your heart stops for a second or so and then you realize your still alive.<br>Next Morning, Monday I took a bus at 6am to Puntarenas still on the main land I took a ferry to Paquera which is on the Pacific peninsula of CR, then a bus too Montezuma I arrived at 2pm had lunch walked around checking out hotels and just hated the place, a shit hole so I headed out, on the 4pm bus to Cobano, which I passed through earlier. when I got there I asked around for a good place they told me that Sta. Teresa and Malpais were good, so I hiked a ride there in the back of a pick up truck, got there at night and I found a place, stayed for 2 nights, it was a surf town. It was my 1st time to see 12 blonds male and female's sitting at different tables at the restaurant. I was eating there off course they where tourist. Because of the strong rains on the Pacific side some roads were closed so I had to go back to go a head. So at 7 am the next day I was back on the bus to Paquera to take the ferry to Puntarenas where I had to wait for 2 hours to take another Ferry back to the peninsula but just a bit more west of where I was earlier, that was Naranjo, I waited with the locals for the bus that took me to Nicoya a change of bus and I was heading too Samara, where I stayed for 4 nights it was a beach town, Roman was the owner of the hotel, a real nice guy, I took a ride with him 2 days later to check out some other towns. Big Halloween Party on the 29Th in Samara. But next day I had that feeling to move on again, so Sunday was my traveling day again 3 bus transfers later I am at La Cruz a border town with Nicaragua where I slept last night and today Monday Oct 31st I am heading into Nicaragua.<br>",156
3,2701,"Best kept secret in Central America, you got it, and it’s Belize. I was planning to stay here for about 10 days but onmy first day here, I thought, 10 days that’s to short, that I should stay for at least 3 weeks. So you wantto know why I say it’s the best kept secret, wellfirst of all English is there main spoken language,it’s a common wealth of England, there are less then300,000 people in the whole country, more then 40% ofthe land in the country is under the Governmentsprotection as National Parks or Nature Reserves, The country is small enough to drivefrom one end to another in just a few hours, theBelize Dollar is set by the Government at $2 Belizefor $1 US, in most of the country it was very clean,and I felt it was very civilized compared to othercountries in Central America, like no throwing outgarbage from the bus window like most people do in allthe other countries I have been to in CA.But most of all it’s their Natural Resources, liketheir Water Fall’s, Cave’s and Beach’s.I crossed the Frontier from Guatemala and headed toSan Ignacio, I was told by other travelers that Belizewas an expensive country, it was clean, that BelizeCity was very dangerous and that the people in Belizedo not bargain with the price, so I had to see if itwas true or if I would be able to haggle my way heretoo. When first looking for a place to stay in SanIgnacio each hotel owner would quote me a price andwould not budge and I tried to haggle with each ofthem but after all I am Jesse and I was able to find aplace and get a 20% discount off the price ""she said$25 Belize,"" I said $20 and after some talking itworked, remember $2 Belize = $1 US.  I stayed there for 4 nights and used it as a base tovisit Cahal Pech Ruins, 1000 Feet Falls which is really 1600feet, Caracol Ruins which is the biggest Maya Ruins inBelize, Rio Frio Caves which I thought were the best cavesthat I have seen so far in Central America, Rio OnPools which is a river that had about 100 meters ofdifferent size water pools on different levels, BigRock Falls which was just another beautiful falls, St.Herman´s Cave which was so dark I did not go into sofar and Blue Hole which they should rename to GreenLagoon. A lot of hitchhiking, I moved fast andaccomplished a lot. I then just stayed over night inthe Capital city which is called Belmopan; its rightin the middle of the country so it was a good transitstop over. But the Capital is so small and the Centralbus station is so quite, all of the buildings are lessthen 3 stories high. Then I headed to Dangriga which Iwas planning to sleep there for two night but it didnot deserve more then two hours of my time to checkout this Port-Beach Town, so quickly I was on my wayto the next stop which was Placencia, which was aPeninsula, I took a bus, then hitchhike to get toMango Creek, then a fast boat to get there. I stayedfor 4 nights and just chilled out on the beach. Thento Punta Gorda to the south east cost of Belize whereI would take a Ferry back to Guatemala.",154
4,2701,"Guatemala, I think is a tourist dream asfar as natural attractions go. I first started off bygoing to Antigua which was the most tourist town thatI have seen in Central America. I stayed there for aweek and past New Year’s Eve there. There were so manypeople there, tourist and locals. It’s a fun littletown that caters to tourist, lots of bars, (good happyhours) restaurants, cafes, but a little on theexpensive side compared to the rest of the country butstill cheap if you compare it to the States. It’s abeautiful Colonial town, with a small square park inthe center of town where I would hang out some timesmeeting some regular people I knew who lived there andgirls who came to visit from out of town, the town wassurrounded with some mountains around it, it also hasa cool climate so it was great for me... Here for somereason I rented a room in an Apt so it was reallycheap for me to stay there. Many travelers come hereto study Spanish and stay at a families house so I newthis so when I got in I looked for a Spanish schooland asked them if they new of a family that had a freeroom to rent for the week and it worked out for me asusual. Next I went to Lake Atitlan, which is a largelake with different villages surrounding it. The firststop was Panajachel which was a tourist supermarket, tourist came here to do there shopping, souvenirs thatis. I just walked through it on my way to the boatlaunch area to go to San Pedro where I stayed for 4nights it was like a hippie village.I have to tell you more about Antigua, I don&apos;t knowwhy but for some reason I really liked that town.While I was there I would walk around the town and seethe different Colonial buildings, and the dozen ormore Churches, this was also the 1st town where theIndigenous Indians where in custom, working in themarket or just walking around. At one point I went toa Macadamia Farm out side the town and on anotheroccasion I did a one day trip to Puerto San Jose whichwas a beach area 2 hours away from Antigua on thePacific cost.So now I can get back to the Hippie Village of SanPedro. By the way San Pedro is one of the cheapest places for travelers to visit in Guatemala. It was a veryrelaxing town in fact I got bored with in a day or soand I wanted to find the Swiss girl who recommendedthis place to me and kill her, but I had to stay theretill the weekend because that was when my companionwas arriving. So to kill the time I went swimming inthe beautiful lake and played water games with thelocal kids that were swimming. I also walked aroundthe whole town and visited the market, in fact here Ihad a little job, not really, I would bring tourist tothe hotel that I was staying at and the hotel bosswould pay me for it. I almost stayed there for freefor the 3 nights. The hotel cost $3 a night and if Ibrought some one over I got $1 and I brought 6 peoplewho stayed multiple nights.I stayed there only the last night with my companion andthen the next day we headed by boat across the lakeback to Panajachel again, from there we where going totake a bus to Guatemala City, I decided I would gohome with her and stay at her place for some days.Most travelers stay away from Guatemala City becauseit is too dangerous but I liked it and we walkedaround a lot in the richer area of town and again Isaw some very new and large shopping malls. From hereI headed to Coban which is in the center of thecountry. Here I find a small B&B which an olderAmerican guy was running, from here I did a day tripto Ray Marcos Caves then to Satana which was a privateEco center with natural water parks and river and lastto Sachichaj which was the best water fall I have seenon my trip so far. In Coban I met a Swedish guy and wewalked around the town together twice, one night wewalked around where even the locals don&apos;t go but asusual we had no problems he wanted to show me some cathouses which he found earlier in the day, we found twoof them but those places were real dingy, dirtyplaces. We ended up at a place called Titanic it was aclean strip club with about 10 girls from otherCentral American countries working there dancing.Then I had an early morning wake up call to catch abus at 6am to Semuc Champey which is a beautiful riverwith multiple pools of water. At one point the rivergoes under ground for 300 meters and then comes upback to the surface. I also visited the town ofLanquin and Languin caves and then hitched hike backto my hotel I think some of the local Indians on thetruck were thinking of having me for dinner or maybejust thinking of rubbing me but I got of to soon forthem to do anything. Here I had to get up even earlierto get out of this place because it is so far awayfrom civilization; it was a 5am wake up call and onthe bus by 5:30. Back to Coban first and then on toanother bus to Sayaxche but 2 hours into the ride Italked my self into getting off the bus and checkingout Candelaria caves which were on the way toSayaxche. So that made it 3 different caves that Ivisited, so no more caves for me for awhile. Afterthe caves I caught 2 more buses which brought mefinally to Sayaxche. At this place I wanted to visitCeibal which is a Maya Ruin but to get there I had totake a boat and they wanted $40 for the ride, and itwas a long day all ready, so I decided against it andcaught another bus to Santa Elena and the island ofFlores where I stayed at a nice hotel with AC, CableTV and Hot water for 5 nights and visited the mostpopular ruin in Guatemala called Tikal which is anational park. I also visited the ruin of Yaxha whereSurvivor was filmed. To get here I took a collectivebus first but then I hitched hike and caught a ridefrom a 70 year old American man who had a motorcyclesince he was a new driver he let me drive and he satin the back. We had an 11 kilometer ride on a dirt roadto get to the ruin. So we walked around together Ishared my map and water with him. On the way back tothe main road we had a flat tire, some truck picked usup and brought us to a house were some one fixed thetire but I had to run because it was all ready 1:30and I still had an hour or so ride back to town andthen I had a 4pm flight to catch. Because then crazyme decided to buy a round trip ticket the day beforeand fly back to Guatemala City to see my littleGuatemalan girl for a few nights. Tomorrow I fly backto Santa Elena airport take a Tuc Tuc which is a 3wheel taxi to Flores Island collect my bag from thehotel that I stayed at and then take a collective busto Belize. But it never happened because I showed uplate for my flight and for the first time in my life Imissed my flight, so every thing I planed for the 24Thwill have to happen on the 25Th. I will be in Belizefor about 10 days and then back to Guatemala to theCaribbean side of the country.While I was in Rio Dulce I visited Castillo San Felipewhich was the best Fortresses I have seen in CentralAmerica, I also visited Finca Paraiso which was anatural HOT WATER FALLS, WOW that was a first in mylife to stand in the pool under a hot water fall, Ihave been to many hot springs but NEVER a hot waterfall. I even forced my friend into the water and underthe hot falls even thou she does not know how to swim; I told her I’ll protect her. ""Trust me"". She was withme until Sunday at 1am and then we walked to the busstation and she caught a late night bus back toGuatemala City, and I headed back to the hotel room.The next morning I left Rio Dulce and headed toLivingston. You can only get there by boat. I stayedthere for 3 nights and visited siete altares which wasa river with multiple pools, over there I got a bitcrazy did some jumping off two water falls into thepools, I slipped once or twice got some small cutshere and there but all was well.Then to Puerto Barrios which was the port townin Guatemala normal prices, lots of peopleand a lot of garbage on the roads.",158
5,2701,"During this week of traveling through the three countries to getto Panama it was so hot, temperatures of 40c or 100f,I need a brake, I need some cold weather, please. The next day I crossed the border into Panama.The first thing I asked for, when I crossed the borderwas ¨Is there a town in Panama that has cool temperatures¨My wish was answered, YES, there is, it´s a town inthe mountains, it´s called Boquete. I guess you know then where I am heading too.So Boquete was just what the doctor ordered. I stayedthere for 5 nights, it was so nice to wake up in themorning and have covers on me and not be sweating, Iactually started wearing my long pants again but onlyat nights. No fan and no AC in the room. Here I walked around the small town and took micro busrides into the mountains. One day I headed by bus intoCaldera, it&apos;s known for it&apos;s thermal pools, but afterborrowing a bicycle from an old man at the local standand riding it on a rocky bumpy road for 40 minutes ,Ireached the thermal pools, and I realized that it wasa waste of time, there were 2 of them about 2 metersround in diameter, that&apos;s it. But to get there I hadto cross over a suspension bridge, so I made the rivermy swimming play ground.After leaving Boquete I checked out two other towns onthe other side of the mountain the first was Volcanand the second Cerro Punta at an altitude of 1,970meters above sea level, here I just visited some hoursand moved on to the city of David. David is the Capital city of the province of Chiriqui,it&apos;s a large commercial town and all the other towns Ivisited earlier were in this province. I stayed therefor three nights I went gambling in a casino and alsovisited the international fair that was going on inthe city. I felt very good about Panama, I thought it was verycivilized compared to the other Central Americancountries, but the problem is that it is hard to findany tourist information about places to visit.So I decided to head to Panama City to find a bettertourist office that could help me find more places tovisit in the country.The eight hour bus ride from David to Panama City wasvery comfortable with AC for a local bus. The busarrived at a large clean and organized bus terminal InPanama City and there was one hotel that had a vanthat was offering a free ride into town and rooms for$22 a night. So off course I took the free ride andchecked out the hotel. It was Saturday night around10pm and as usual I knew nothing about Panama City.Just from the ride alone into town I knew that I wouldstay here at least 10 nights, its just a feeling thatI get in the first moments of arriving to a new place.The hotel was nice, it had every thing that I waslooking for, private bathroom with hot water, largebed, clean room, cable TV, and AC. I told the managerthat I was planing to stay a while and needed a betterprice, but the lowest he could go to was $18 a nightwhich was still too high, so we talked some more andhe told me that they have another hotel three blocksaway for $15 a night. They drove me there and it wasas good as the first hotel, so I took it at $15 anight. By Monday I new I would be here at least twoweeks and so I checked around other hotels and talkedwith my hotel and they lowered my price to $13 anight. So that is where I still am. I have been herenow for 14 nights, I have two more paid nights and onApril 2ND at 6am I will fly into the jungle and staythere for a few days/nights , I will leave my bigbackpack at the hotel and just take my small pack withme. I should be out by April 7Th. Wish me luck.I don´t know if it was necessary to stay so long inPanama City but it is the most impressive Capital Cityin Central America and I did get to see the whole cityand used it as a base to rest up and to visit othercity&apos;s/towns like Colon, where Columbus landed in1502. I also visited Portobelo where the Spanish built afort to protect their interest and off course Ivisited the Panama Canal a few times.I must be getting lazy after two days of the NativeIndian Islands in San Blas I missed the comforts of mylife in Panama City and I wanted to leave. so there I was, in so called paradise, beautifulweather, clean white sand beaches, palm trees,gorgeous blue clear water, peace and quite, no people,and I discovered something about myself, this was notmy paradise, after about one hour I was bored thepeace and quite was too much for me, I discovered thatmy paradise is TV, AC, restaurants, bars, malls,streets and buildings, noise, people and action. Now I know what is my paradise, what keeps mepeaceful, alive and interested, it´s city life andthat is all right, at least now I know what makes metick, what rocks my boat. In El Porvenir area in San Blas I visited 9 differentIslands or areas by air plane and/or boat, I slept ina hut in Nalunega Island, I talked with the natives,played with the children, even gave them potato chips,and sat in, the daily evening Indian town councilmeeting. These places had no hot water, no fresh waterfor showers, no electricity, and not too many comfortsof home. I am happy that I saw it and more happy thatI left. Like I said earlier maybe I am getting lazyand I got use too my hotel in Panama City, you knowwhat that means, I have to get my ass in gear andstart moving again.",161
6,2701,"It seems to me that some times I am moving very fastthrew some countries. Honduras is one of them. I mightbe getting tired or bored and some times things startto look alike in these countries. After all I amvisiting: Water Falls, Rivers, Lakes, Beach’s,Mountains, Jungles, Volcano&apos;s, Maya Ruins, Caves,Forts, Special towns, Port towns, Capitals,Peninsulas, Islands and so on. But I think that’s it.I started the adventure in Honduras byhitchhiking right from the border in the back of apick up truck, always great views from the back of atruck, which lasted the whole day and brought me toOmoa a beach town with a Fort, then to Puerto Cortesanother beach town, then to San Pedro Sula which wasinland and is the second largest city in Honduras andfinally to Tela, which is another beach town where Islept for the night. The next day I took a bus to La Ceiba which wasanother beach town but again I had bad weather, lotsof rain but I found a good place to have BBQ Chickenand steak. From here the next morning I could take aFerry to the Island of Roatan which is the largestHonduras Island in the Caribbean.I relaxed there for three nights but the rain was onand off, so then I headed to a town called Graciaswhich was in the mountains in the south west part ofthe country. Stayed there for two nights and visited aFort, nice small town to walk around, I thought it hada lot of hotels for it size. Then to Copan Ruins whichbrings me to today Sunday, I took my friend to theborder crossing, then had lunch andthen I sat down in this Internet Cafe for four hoursand caught up with all my e-mails and stories.Tomorrow I will visit the Ruins here, which aresupposed to be the best and largest Ruins in Honduras.Then onto Utila Island, I was hungry and I had noidea where I would sleep the night. This is normal forme, the adventure of the unknown when I first get to aplace; it’s what I live for when I am traveling. To get to a place and not know anything about theplace.So I did the simple thing I asked around and went to arestaurant that was 2 minutes away from the ferry dockand had a great dinner and a few rum and cokes, bytime I finished eating and drinking it was around 10pmat night, I was told that I could find a cheap room upthe road, I found it, a simple room with a bed and fanwas $3 a night. I had to share the bathroom but for a nightit’s fine.The next day I got up and asked the hotel owner if Icould leave my bags in the room while I would belooking for a better place.She said fine and my search to find a better roomstarted.Usually after 2 hours or so of walking aroundchecking every hotel, I find the place that I am looking for. By doing this, not only do I find the best place tosleep at, but also I get to know the streets in thecity or town where I am planning to stay for somedays. I also meet a lot of local people this way andin the days to come get to see them again and chatwith them. In this case, I found an Apt that had two bedrooms. Iwould have one of the bedrooms that had two beds in itwith a fan and cable TV.I would share the kitchen and bathroom, but at thistime no one else rented the other private bedroom, soI had the whole apt to my self and this cost me $16 anight, I was planning to stay there at least a week todo my open water driving course. I have found so many great and cheap places to sleepin; in all the countries I traveled too, most of thetime, this way.The next day I started the same way to look for theschool that I would take the open water diving coursewith.But the more I looked, the more I felt that I did notwant to take the course here on Utila Island, I feltit was like a production line of tourist coming to theisland for one thing. For the cheapest and quickestway to get an open water diving license it was about$240 for a three day course and it did not feel likeit was fun. After going to about 10 schools I decidednot to do it. So now I was on this Island that hadsand flees that bite real hard every where on yourbody all the time no matter where you are and had noplans to get my open water diving license.I felt it was time to move on. After staying on Utila Island for a week, I traveledto the Capital of Honduras, Tegucigalpa and stayedthere for one night.",159
7,2701,"Well, they say Iceland is green and Greenland is icy, and I can tell you that, that statement is true. Its summer here and I never saw anything green here, no grass, no trees, no weeds, just no green. I arrived to Nuuk which is the Capital of Greenland on a small plane, the airport was between two mountains and water on one side, once the plane landed you walked a minute to the building and a minute later you had your bag, there was no customs or immigration officers, no bank, no duty free, nothing and then it was 10 seconds and I was out of the building on my way, I was told that the town was a five minute bus ride away but I did not have any of the local currency but as usual I started to look for a ride and after asking the first person for directions he offered to give me a lift. There is about 16,000 people in the capital, so that guy who gave me the ride, I would see him later on the same day and a few more times before I left, and that’s how small it was. The Greenlandic people were very friendly and are similar looking to Eskimo’s from Alaska the other type of people that are there are Danish people since Greenland is a Danish territory, it felt like I went back in time, about 50 years. There was only 1 hotel in the whole town, 1 bank, 2 supermarkets were lots of the locals would hang out between them trying to sell their belongings on the side walk, no fast food chains at all, 2 traffic lights, no internet café’s, they just finished building the culture center so they showed films there, the police head quarters was in the same structure as the parliament building, at the only fish market they sold seals, I liked it, a new place to explore. No one in Greenland can own land so if some one had a house they had no front or back yard; there were also many ghetto style block buildings five floors high in the center of town, but yet the town as a whole was colorful, the roads were bad and it was quite dirty but great views of mountains every where, great scenery of the beautiful Nuuk fiord which is one of the largest fiords in Greenland, where you could see wild seals and icebergs floating by and the whole town was surrounded by water. Like Iceland it was never dark here, I think sunset was around midnight and 30 minutes later it was sunrise. I would say I was there about four hours when I was invited to some ones house for tea the host wanted to practice his English on me, he said he did not speak English for eight years or so, it was a big deal for his family to have me visit their home, they lived in those blocked buildings, there I tried some dried aged Polar bear meat. I could live with out it. Even thou the surroundings looked poor and Greenland is considered a third world country, lots of people were out of work and there is here a bit of a local drinking problem the prices were similar to Iceland, unbelievable. I had a few contacts here before arriving here, so I quickly got in touch with them and made some new friends here. We would hang out together; walk around together, party together, and go boating together;I really just had a peaceful good time here, spending time with them. After that I was staying in some ones home out in no mans land just enjoying the simple life, of walking around and climbing mountains and enjoying the nature. No stress and no schedule.",229
8,2701,"Stayed here for 19 nights, 17 of those nights in the Capital city of San Salvador. Very well developed Capital, huge shopping malls, any kind of food here, great transportation to get around, by the way their currency here is the US Dollar and The US has one of its biggest Embassies here. By the way there are very few tourist here.I found a great little guest house in a residential area so I made it my home and once again used it as a base to move around the country.It takes 2 hours or less to get to all the places I visited, which was two thirds of the country and the public buses were fine and cheap to use. So here is the places I visited.   In one day I went to Joya de Ceren, San Andres, El Tazumal and Casa Blanca all were Archaeological sites of Mayan pyramids and a Mayan town that was buried under volcanic ashes.  On another day I visited Olocuilta, which is a town famous for Papooses which is the national food here, its a salty pancake with bean paste and cheese in side of it, then drove through Costa del Sol beach and Bocana Cordoneillo which is a peninsula area. I saw some homes destroyed there from a storm.  Another trip was a sleep over in Juayua on A Sunday night, the town has a Gastronomical Fair every weekend. I walked around had things to eat, lots of crafts to see. The next day I visited the 3 water falls that are in that town.  The next over night trip was to Suchitoto which is a Colonial Town and it had a beautiful lake with great views of the mountains surrounding it. The next day I went to La Palma which is a small crafts town on the way to El Pital the highest mountain in this country 2,730 meters.Today I visited La Libertad a fish port and 3 other Beach&apos;s,El Sunzal, El Tunco a surfing beach and Majahual where I saw the most amount of people swimming in their clothes, that&apos;s right in this country they swim in their clothes.",157

I wentthere for Passover service but had the dinner at theRabbis house of another Synagogue. The Capital is full of color, I mean the buildings areso colorful, that you can take a 100 pictures andstill want to take more.Here I would walk around every day. Also I sat at acafe and eat. Went out at night which was most of thetime, very quite there. You see otrabanda and Punda the other side ofWillemstad are mostly for tourist, so the locals goout mostly to bars or cafes inland. I went there too,but not my cup of tea. I guess its the people.I also checked out a beach or two but that was it.Since I travel with one way air tickets to get fromone island to another, I went with this small airlinecompany, that has small airplanes that holds ninepassengers, four rows with two passengers on each rowand one person must sit by the pilot either side ofhim, because both sides have the wheel and all of thecontrols, yes, you can guess where I sat? And once thepilot got the airplane up in the air guess who tookthe wheel and announced to the other passengers thatthe Co Pilot is now flying the plane? You are rightboth times.Bonaire, was my second stop and it is the smallest ofthe three islands. Here I was lucky enough to meet awomen who picked me up after watching a small paradethat they had in Rincon which was the town where theslaves use to live in the past and after talking withher a bit, she decided to show me her island. Shedropped off her Mom and picked up her kids and thendrove me around, we visited the solar salt works, morethen one lighthouse, the old slave huts, fort, thehighest mountain, and the windsurfing area. I stayedin the capital city that is called Kralendijk it wasfive minutes away from the airport and the heart wherethe tourist stay. Here I felt the white Dutch mastershad too much power and the kind black slaves were sogenerous. I stayed here the least time, and wanted tomove on.Last to Aruba, believe it or not but I could find ahotel with a reasonable price, $30 a night after sometalking and I did pay the first night $40 at anotherhotel. It had AC, cable TV and a private bathroom andall within fifteen minutes walk to the center of town.I guess the manager there so something special in meand and let me give her $150 in cash in advance for 5nights. Just kidding, but that is what happened. Butmy relationship with her grew and we would have a lotof talks about life and her plans. I either got real close to her or made her feel realguilty but she became my occasional ride from thehotel to some place, and also I had her volunteer togive me a tour of the Island. She took me to the oldDutch windmill, Hooiberg which is the tallest mountainwhich I hiked up for the view, Casibart rockformation, Bushiribana ruins, Natural bridge over thesea, the town of San Nicolas that had a huge refinery,and also a few beaches. Don&apos;t think that I did not seeanything on my own here, I visited the Californialighthouse which is on the most northern point andalso the Alto vista Chapel the oldest church on theIsland. I went to the Synagogue for Friday nightservices. I sat through two time share presentationsand got some gifts and went to one casino and gave itall back and more by playing Baccarat again. Butbecause I lost some money I could ask the CasinoManager for some tickets to the Cabaret dance show andon the last night there, I surprised my Hotel Managerwith tickets for her, her family and me.

Here I was lucky enough to meet awomen who picked me up after watching a small paradethat they had in Rincon which was the town where theslaves use to live in the past and after talking withher a bit, she decided to show me her island. Shedropped off her Mom and picked up her kids and thendrove me around, we visited the solar salt works, morethen one lighthouse, the old slave huts, fort, thehighest mountain, and the windsurfing area. I stayedin the capital city that is called Kralendijk it wasfive minutes away from the airport and the heart wherethe tourist stay. Here I felt the white Dutch mastershad too much power and the kind black slaves were sogenerous. I stayed here the least time, and wanted tomove on.Last to Aruba, believe it or not but I could find ahotel with a reasonable price, $30 a night after sometalking and I did pay the first night $40 at anotherhotel. It had AC, cable TV and a private bathroom andall within fifteen minutes walk to the center of town.I guess the manager there so something special in meand and let me give her $150 in cash in advance for 5nights. Just kidding, but that is what happened. Butmy relationship with her grew and we would have a lotof talks about life and her plans. I either got real close to her or made her feel realguilty but she became my occasional ride from thehotel to some place, and also I had her volunteer togive me a tour of the Island. She took me to the oldDutch windmill, Hooiberg which is the tallest mountainwhich I hiked up for the view, Casibart rockformation, Bushiribana ruins, Natural bridge over thesea, the town of San Nicolas that had a huge refinery,and also a few beaches. Don&apos;t think that I did not seeanything on my own here, I visited the Californialighthouse which is on the most northern point andalso the Alto vista Chapel the oldest church on theIsland. I went to the Synagogue for Friday nightservices. I sat through two time share presentationsand got some gifts and went to one casino and gave itall back and more by playing Baccarat again. Butbecause I lost some money I could ask the CasinoManager for some tickets to the Cabaret dance show andon the last night there, I surprised my Hotel Managerwith tickets for her, her family and me.

Napa 
From San Francisco, we drove to Napa. Our bed and breakfast was called Chateau de Vie, a charming home nestled in the vineyards. The atmosphere was welcoming right away. Our hosts offered us their wine and a plate of cheese while we settled our things in. After, we went into the small town of Calistoga to eat dinner. The best part about Chateau de Vie was the breakfast. The bed and breakfast was run by a middle-aged couple. One of the men had gone to school to become a chef and the food was just out of this world. Of course, we couldn't go to Napa without touring a winery, so we chose to go to the Beringer estate for the afternoon. While the tour was only forty minutes long and over-priced, it was still cool to see the beautiful estate and learn a little about the history.

I also visited Israel in December 2018, where I visited the Old City and had dinner in&nbsp;Machane Yehuda market, and&nbsp;August 1998, when I spent most of my time in Jerusalem in each of the Old City&#39;s four quarters: (1) Muslim Quarter (at the time of my visit it was easy to access the Temple Mount and the Dome of the Rock, the oldest existing Islamic building in the world), (2) Christian Quarter (the Church of the Holy Sepulchre), (3) Armenian Quarter (the Cathedral of St. James, a 12th century Armenian church), and (4) Jewish Quarter (Western Wall).

December 2000 -- I spent time in and around La Paz and visited Mercado de Hechiceria (the witches&#39; market), where vendors sell all sorts of ritual items, especially llama fetuses. The oddest place to eat was Confiter&iacute;a Club de La Paz because it disturbingly was one of Klaus Barbie&#39;s favorite local restaurants until he was arrested in Bolivia in 1983. The main purpose of my trip was to bicycle down the &quot;world&#39;s most dangerous road,&quot; a 38-mile road leading from La Paz to Coroico (one estimate is that more than 200 vehicle passengers were killed yearly along the road and at least 18 cyclists have died on the ride since 1998). During the most treacherous part of the two-way road it is narrow, single-lane (in some parts not more than 10 feet in width), without a guardrail and lined with extreme drop-offs of at least 2,000 feet.

Paris is one of the world&#39;s best museum cities, and I have visited Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Mus&eacute;e Rodin, Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay, Mus&eacute;e Jacquemart-Andr&eacute;, Mus&eacute;e National d&#39;Histoire Naturelle, Galerie de Pal&eacute;ontologie et d&rsquo;Anatomie Compar&eacute;e, Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen Age, Mus&eacute;e de l&#39;Orangerie, Mus&eacute;e Marmottan Monet and Centre Pompidou. Paris also offers a wealth of additional interesting sites, some of my favorites being Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re-Lachaise, H&ocirc;tel des Invalides, Les Catacombes, Les Egouts and Deyrolle, established in 1831 and the world&#39;s best taxidermy shop (http://www.deyrolle.com). Paris is also one of the world&#39;s best dining destinations, and I have eaten in most of the historic restaurants, including Le Procope (opened 1686), Polidor (1845), Aux Charpentiers (1856), Brasserie Flo (1860), Bofinger (1864), Brasserie Lipp (1880), Cafe Les Deux Magots (1885), Taverne Henri IV (1885), Brasserie Balzar (1886), Caf&eacute; de Flore (1887), Chartier (1896), Le Vaudeville (1918), L&#39;Ami Louis (1924), Terminus Nord (1925), Allard (1930), Chez Jenny (1930), Taillevent (1946) and Chez George (1964). In May 2012 I stayed at Hotel La Louisiane, which is rundown but well located and was the hotel of choice of many American jazz musicians, like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bud Powell, during the 1940s and early 1950s (http://www.hotel-lalouisiane.com/).</p>

9,111,"<p>November 2018 --&nbsp;I visited Conakry, the capital of Guinea, with a team that grew from the driver I had initially retained to include a translator and journalist, so my day was featured on his afternoon radio broadcast. Our first stop was the Centre d&#39;Art Acrobatique Keita Fodeba, which Lonely Planet oversells as perhaps the single most amazing experience in Guinea, although its mission to instruct street children in acrobatics and provide vocational training is commendable. &nbsp;I&nbsp;stopped for a drink at Restaurant Obama Club, a wooden shack that sits on stilts on the Conakry coast overlooking the fishing harbor at Port de Boulbinet. The nearby fish market sells everything that can be hauled out of the ocean, including enormous rays. From the malodorous market I retreated to my hotel&rsquo;s infinity pool to await my flight (http://conakry.noomhotels.com).</p>

10,111,"<p>November 2018 --&nbsp;I visited Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, which as its name might reveal was established in the eighteenth century as a settlement for freed slaves from England, the United States and Canada. &nbsp;By the early nineteenth century Freetown had became a British Crown colony, and I tracked down several of the remaining colonial-era buildings, including the original building at Fourah Bay College, the oldest college in West Africa. &nbsp;I also spent two days at&nbsp;Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary on the outskirts of Freetown, which works to rescue and rehabilitate chimpanzees orphaned by the illegal pet trade or the slaughter of their mothers for bushmeat. I made my arrangement with Bimbola Carrol at VSL Travel (https://www.visitsierraleone.org).</p>
",407
11,111,"<p>November 2018 -- I spent a few days in Amsterdam on my way to Sierra Leone. &nbsp;On my first full day,&nbsp;I took an early train to &#39;s-Hertogenbosch, where the medieval center was relatively unscathed by World War II. Sint-Janskathedraal represents the height of gothic architecture in the Netherlands, but nowadays tourists visit the cathedral to photograph the statue atop one of its buttresses of an angel wearing jeans, holding a pocketbook and using a mobile phone. Den Bosch&rsquo;s other well known statues are of Jheronimus van Aken, born in &lsquo;s-Hertogenbosch so popularly referred to as Hieronymus Bosch, famous for his nightmarish paintings of the underworld, and the gilded Dragon Fountain. &nbsp;On my second day, I took an early train to meet Els Slots to&nbsp;visit the windmill network at Kinderdijk, less than a half hour from where she lives. Around 1740, the Dutch built nineteen windmills to drain water from low-lying land in the village of Kinderdijk, now the largest concentration of historic windmills in the Netherlands. &nbsp;I also revisited&nbsp;the Rijksmuseum&nbsp;and the Van Gogh Museum.</p>

<p>May 2015 -- I visited several World Heritage Sites, including Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis in Utrecht, Droogmakerij de Beemster (Beemster Polder), Ir.D.F. Woudagemaal (D.F. Wouda Steam Pumping Station), Schokland and Surroundings, and the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Muiden Fortress). I also wandered around Amsterdam, where I ate at Haesje Claes, founded in 1974 (http://www.haesjeclaes.nl/), and drank at Caf&eacute; Hoppe, which has been located on the Spui since 1670 (http://cafehoppe.com/).<br />
<br />
August 2003 -- I made a short visit to Amsterdam while traveling from Nairobi to New York and visited the Rijksmuseum.<br />
<br />
November 2001 -- I based myself in Amsterdam, where I stayed at the American Hotel, established in 1900 and well located on Leidseplein. My primary goal was to visit Mauritshuis, an art museum in The Hague that holds three of the 34 works firmly attributed to Johannes Vermeer, including <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> and <em>View of Delft.</em> I also visited Delft, where I stood on the site where <em>View of Delft</em> was painted, Haarlem and Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, the oldest zoo in the Netherlands.<br />
<br />
August 1994 -- I spent several days in Amsterdam, where I visited Anne Frankhuis, Museum Het Rembrandthuis, the Rijksmuseum, one of the world&#39;s great painting museums, and the Van Gogh Museum. Two of my favorite restaurants on this trip were D&#39;Vijff Vlieghen and the Pancake Bakery (http://www.pancake.nl/), and bars were Caf&eacute; Chris, opened in 1624, and Caf&eacute; Hoppe.</p>
",301
12,111,"<p>October 2018 -- I began my trip in Luxor, where I visited the&nbsp;Colossi of Memnon, a pair of giant stone statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III; the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Pharaoh Ramses II, best known for the collapsed statue of the pharaoh that inspired Percy Bysshe Shelley to write Ozymandias, his most famous poem;&nbsp;the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III, which was excavated starting in the 1920s by archaeologists from the University of Chicago;&nbsp;the Valley of the Kings;&nbsp;the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut; the Luxor Museum; Karnak Temple; and&nbsp;Luxor Temple. &nbsp;I spent a few days in Cairo, where I visited the Egyptian Museum and&nbsp;the Giza Plateau, and ate at Farahat Pigeon Restaurant,&nbsp;Alfy Bey,&nbsp;Abou Tarek, Felfela Restaurant and Caf&eacute; Riche (opened in 1908). &nbsp;I also made a day trip from Aswan to&nbsp;Abu Simbel, two massive rock temples in Nubia, near Egypt&rsquo;s southern border with Sudan. The twin temples were carved out of the mountainside more than 3,000 years ago, but eventually became buried by Sahara desert sand and forgotten until 1813, when found by the same Swiss orientalist who discovered Petra just a year before. &nbsp;In the 1960s, Egypt began constructing the Aswan High Dam to control&nbsp;Nile flooding, provide water for irrigation and generate hydroelectricity, but whose rising waters would submerge the temples. It was decided to relocate the temples to higher ground. So, between 1964 and 1968, the temples were cut into massive blocks, dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 meters higher and 200 meters farther from the Nile onto a purpose-built hill.</p>

<p>January 2014 -- I traveled by train from Ramses Railway Station, the main railway station of Cairo, to Alexandria, where I had lunch at the Cecil Hotel, which opened in 1929. &nbsp;At the Cecil Hotel, I arranged a car and driver to visit the Christian monastery of Abu Mena, but I was not able to gain access to the archaeological ruins.<br />
<br />
December 2012 -- During a two-day stopover in Cairo I visited Wadi Al-Hitan, a paleontological site that reveals evidence for the explanation of the emergence of the whale as an ocean-going mammal, and made my arrangements with Egypt Panorama Tours (http://eptours.com/). I stayed at the Windsor Hotel (http://www.windsorcairo.com/) and ate at Abou Tarek (which only serves kushari), Alfy Bey (opened in 1938) and Felfela Restaurant (opened in 1963).<br />
<br />
May 2001 -- I stopped in Cairo for one day while returning from Saudi Arabia and revisited the Giza plateau and Egyptian Museum.<br />
<br />
August 1998 -- I had a business trip to Alexandria, where I stayed at the Cecil Hotel, built in 1929, and visited the corniche and the Citadel of Qaitbay. I finished this trip in Cairo, where I stayed at the Cairo Marriott Hotel, originally the Al Gezira Palace, which was built to house Napoleon&#39;s wife, Empress Eugenie of France.<br />
<br />
August 1997 -- I started my trip in Cairo, where I split my time between Giza and downtown. In Giza I stayed at the Mena House, established in 1869, and visited the Giza Necropolis, including the Great Sphinx and the Great Pyramid (which I entered to descend to the King&#39;s Chamber). From Giza, I visited Saqqara and its Pyramid of Djoser (the step pyramid). From Giza I moved to downtown Cairo and stayed at the Nile Hilton because it was a short walk from the Egyptian Museum, one of the best museums that I have visited. I also visited Islamic Cairo, including Mohammed Ali Mosque in the Citadel and Khan el-Khalili souk (with Fishawi&#39;s Coffeehouse), the City of the Dead, a bustling grid of tombs and mausoleums where people live and work, and made a day trip to the Birqash Camel Market. From Cairo I flew to Luxor, where I began on its West Bank and visited the Colossi of Memnon, the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut and the Valley of the Kings, and then its East Bank, where I visited the Luxor Temple and Karnak Temple.</p>
",372
13,111,"<p>October 2018 -- I began my trip in&nbsp;Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan and the largest city in northern Iraq. &nbsp;The ancient Citadel of Erbil has possibly been occupied for 7,000 years, since the fifth millennium BCE, making Erbil one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas in the world, although that&rsquo;s somewhat contrived. In 2007, all but one of the 840 families living on the citadel were evicted prior to the start of a restoration project &mdash; a single family has been allowed to remain to ensure that there would be no interruption in the seven millenniums of unbroken inhabitation of the mound. The Citadel of Erbil was inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites in 2014. &nbsp;I visited Amna Suraka in Sulaymaniyah,&nbsp;the northern headquarters for Chemical Ali and the Iraqi Intelligence Service, who used Amna Suraka for the imprisonment, torture and execution of Kurds. In 1991, the Kurdish Peshmerga gained control of the prison, which has been maintained in its original condition and turned into a museum. The only change has been the addition of life-size statues of prisoners being beaten, hanging from electrical wires, and blindfolded and handcuffed.</p>
",827
14,111,"<p>September 2018 --&nbsp;I took a marshrutka from Saint Petersburg to Gatchina Palace, one of the favorite residences of the Russian imperial family. The House of Romanov owned many grand palaces around Saint Petersburg, which were collectively added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1990.</p>
",707
15,111,"<p>September 2018 --&nbsp;I took local bus 120п&nbsp;from Sochi to the Russian border and crossed into the Republic of Abkhazia, a de facto state in northwestern Georgia only recognized by Russia and four other countries, in the case of one (Nauru) likely in return for $50 million in aid from Russia. Nearly all other sovereign states view Abkhazia as an integral part of Georgia. So Abkhazia now exists in limbo as one of several post-Soviet frozen conflicts where active armed fighting has ceased but the combatants have not agreed to a political framework to resolve their dispute. If Abkhazia has a tourist center, it&rsquo;s New Athos, around 14 miles from Sukhumi on the shores of the Black Sea, where I visited Novy Afon Monastery, which was founded in the late nineteenth century by monks who arrived from Mount Athos in Greece. The nearby medieval Anacopia Fortress, reached after climbing a dozen steep switchbacks, allowed panoramic vistas from above the monastery. I stayed at Leon Hotel (https://leonhotel.net), and my favorite place to eat was Cafe Lika, where chef/owner Lika only prepares a few Abkhaz dishes each night, and her eponymous cafe closes when the food runs out.</p>
",470
16,111,"<p>September 2018 -- I visited Sochi during my trip to Abkhazia. &nbsp;The most interesting site in the Sochi area is the&nbsp;now largely abandoned Sochi Olympic Park from the 2014 Winter Olympics, which houses Fisht Olympic Stadium and the venues that were used for indoor sports such as ice hockey, figure skating, curling and speed skating. Russia spent $51 billion on the quadrennial winter games, the most expensive Olympics of all time, and now spends thousands more each day to maintain the underutilized venues.</p>
",683
17,111,"<p>September 2018 -- I flew from&nbsp;Murmansk to Simferopol, the de facto capital of Crimea, and caught a bus at the airport to Sevastopol, the largest city on the Crimean Peninsula and a major Black Sea port. Like many cities in the former Soviet Union, Sevastopol is stocked with war memorials, monuments and statues, yet empty of international tourists deterred by its political status and sanctions imposed by Western governments in response to the annexation of Crimea by Russia. I had to bring a stack of Russian rubles because my ATM and credit cards were useless. &nbsp;I took a&nbsp;local bus from Sevastopol&nbsp;to Chersonesus, an ancient Greek colony founded 2,500 years ago on the Black Sea, now located in the outskirts of Sevastopol. The site, nicknamed the Ukrainian Pompeii, was successively controlled by the Greek, Roman and Byzantine Empires, and is the only World Heritage Site on the Crimean Peninsula. &nbsp;I stayed at the&nbsp;Sevastopol Hotel, opened in 1959 and the city&#39;s oldest hotel (https://sevastopol-hotel.com.ru/en/).</p>

<p>I took a bus from Sevastopol to Yalta, on the southern coast of Crimea. &nbsp;There are frequent boats&nbsp;to the Swallow&#39;s Nest, designed to look like a medieval knight&#39;s castle, but really an architectural folly built primarily for decorative purposes. The small castle supposedly earned its name because it sits like a swallow&rsquo;s nest on steep cliffs overlooking the Black Sea. &nbsp;I also took a local bus to&nbsp;Livadia Palace just outside Yalta, which hosted the Yalta Conference in 1945 among President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Joseph Stalin to shape a post-war peace and to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe following WWII. I stayed at the Bristol Hotel, the oldest hotel in Yalta (http://bristol-yalta.ru).</p>

<p>I traveled by local bus from Yalta to Simferopol, where I stayed at&nbsp;Ukraina Hotel, the oldest in the city, and a short walk from the restaurants on pedstrianized Ul. Karla Marksa, where I ate at 23 Cafe Boulangerie (http://www.23cafe.ru).</p>
",253
18,111,"<p>September 2018 --&nbsp;I spent a couple of days in&nbsp;Murmansk, by far the largest city north of the Arctic Circle (although the population has been declining since the end of the Cold War). The port of Murmansk remains ice-free year round due to the warm Gulf Stream, so is home port to the world&#39;s only fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers. I visited the <em>Lenin</em>, a Soviet-era nuclear-powered icebreaker launched in 1957, when it was the world&#39;s first nuclear-powered surface ship. The <em>Lenin</em> was decommissioned in 1989 because its hull had worn thin from ice friction, and now offers Russian-language tours to see the nuclear reactors that powered its four steam turbines. &nbsp;My favorite restaurants were game at&nbsp;Restaurant Tsarskaya Okhota and&nbsp;Tundra Grill &amp; Bar and cafe was White Rabbit.</p>
",711
19,111,"<p>September 2018 --&nbsp;I took an early morning train for the three-hour trip from Saint Petersburg to Veliky Novgorod, founded in 859 and traditionally considered the cradle of Russian statehood. Veliky Novgorod is now recognized for dozens of medieval monuments, including monasteries, churches and Kremlin, all added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1992. But the memory of the bear sausage I ate at lunch at Dom Berga (https://www.domberga.ru/en/) will linger longer than that of Russia&rsquo;s foundational religious buildings.</p>
",713
20,111,"<p>November 1998 and August 2018&nbsp;-- During my most recent trip,&nbsp;I visited Museu do Amanh&atilde;, Rio de Janeiro&rsquo;s newest architectural marvel, which opened in December 2015 as part of the port renewal in advance of the 2016 Summer Olympics. The science museum&rsquo;s tendentious exhibits were no match for the waterfront structure, one of architect Santiago Calatrava&rsquo;s skeletal white buildings. &nbsp;I also visited the&nbsp;National Museum of Brazil, which was&nbsp;heavily damaged by a large fire on September 2, 2018, less than a month after my visit, and&nbsp;Jardim Zool&oacute;gico do Rio de Janeiro, which displays a diverse collection of parrots and New World monkeys. &nbsp;More than a thousand favelas, Brazilian-Portuguese for slum, cover the hillsides around Rio de Janeiro. The favelas have historically been controlled by drug traffickers and criminal gangs, so have been beyond the reach of police. In 2011, the Brazilian military launched a security operation in Rocinha, the largest favela, to bring control to the community. Due to its relative safety, entrepreneurial local residents have been offering tours in Rocinha. &nbsp;In September 2017, gun battles broke out in Rocinha between rival drug dealers, similar to the climactic shootout between Lil Z&eacute; and Knockout Ned in <em>City of God</em>, so the Brazilian army returned to restore order. Since then, sporadic gunfights have broken out between gang members and the police &mdash; but Rocinha seemed tranquil when I visited, under a watchful police presence. &nbsp;During my first visit, I stayed at the Copacabana Palace Hotel, established in 1923, and visited Cristo Redentor and P&atilde;o de A&ccedil;&uacute;car.</p>
",593
21,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I visited Jo&atilde;o Pessoa, the capital of the Brazilian state of Para&iacute;ba and the easternmost city in the Americas, closer to Africa than to southernmost Brazil. Jo&atilde;o Pessoa was founded in 1585 and is the country&rsquo;s third oldest city, but only a few square blocks remain of its colorful historic center. It only took me a couple of hours to visit the historic center and its ornate churches and monasteries, so I ended the day on Praia do Cabo Branco, one of the city&rsquo;s best beaches, where&nbsp;I had dinner at Pontal do Cabo (<em>http://www.pontaldocabo.com.br</em>).</p>
",589
22,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I visited Porto Alegre, the capital of the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, including the city&#39;s largest art collection at Museu de Arte do Rio Grande do Sul. &nbsp;My favorite meals were at&nbsp;Restaurante&nbsp;Gambrinus, which has been open in&nbsp;Mercado P&uacute;blico&nbsp;de&nbsp;Porto Alegre since 1889 (<em>http://www.gambrinus.com.br</em>), and&nbsp;Restaurant Barranco, which has been serving the city&#39;s best steaks since 1969 (<em>http://www.churrascariabarranco.com.br</em>).</p>
",595
23,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I took an early morning (5:00 am) shared taxi from Jo&atilde;o Pessoa to Natal, the capital of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte. I arrived early enough to hire a dune buggy to spend the day &ldquo;roller coastering&rdquo; up and down the huge Genipabu sand dunes along the Atlantic Ocean just north of Natal. We had to raft the dune buggy across a river to get to the dunes. On the return, we skirted the sand dunes by speeding along the beach for fifteen miles. I spent my second day&nbsp;on Ponta Negra beach in Natal, within view of Morro do Careca (Bald Hill), a large sand dune that has become the city&rsquo;s landmark and that sits at the southern curve of the beach.</p>
",594
24,111,"<p>August 2018 -- On my first afternoon,&nbsp;I visited Parque das Aves, an aviary in Foz do Igua&ccedil;u, which exhibits more than 1,500 birds from 150 species, most from Brazil, including toucans and parrots and plenty of unusual birds that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before. More than half of the birds were rescued from mistreatment or animal trafficking. The park rehabilitates and releases into the wild as many of its birds as possible. &nbsp;I spent the next&nbsp;morning at Igua&ccedil;u Falls on the border between Brazil and Argentina, the largest cataract system in the world. &nbsp;Igua&ccedil;u National Park in Brazil was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1987, three years after the complementary park in Argentina. &nbsp;Commentators often claim that one side of the falls is superior to the other, but having also visited Iguazu Falls on the Argentinian side in 2011, in my view, it&rsquo;s a tie and both sides rank among the world&rsquo;s greatest natural wonders as the best waterfall system.</p>
",590
25,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I visited&nbsp;Florian&oacute;polis, the capital of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil. &nbsp;Florian&oacute;polis is best known for its beaches, so the historic center doesn&rsquo;t attract many overseas visitors, not surprising given the dearth of sites. The most noteworthy site is the Pal&aacute;cio Cruz e Sousa, formerly the government palace, where&nbsp;I had to don felt slippers to protect the hardwood inlaid floors, which are extraordinary, especially in the music parlor. &nbsp;In the afternoon, I ventured nine miles down the coast from Florian&oacute;polis to Ribeir&atilde;o da Ilha, which was colonized by Azorean immigrants and is now known for its oyster farms, to have lunch at Ostradamus Restaurante (<em>http://www.ostradamus.com.br</em>). &nbsp;The restaurant sits on a pier with a view of the oyster pens in the bay between Santa Catarina Island and the mainland, and is one of the country&rsquo;s best spots for the delicious bivalves.</p>
",598
26,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I spent a few days in&nbsp;Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. In the late nineteenth century, when fortunes were being made during Brazil&rsquo;s rubber boom, the Teatro Amazonas was constructed in Manaus, according to legend to attract Enrico Caruso to the middle of the world&rsquo;s largest rainforest (although it&rsquo;s doubtful that the great tenor performed there). On my first night, I attended a performance&nbsp;to see the interior of the opera house, underneath its trompe-l&#39;&oelig;il ceiling that is meant to evoke the view from beneath the Eiffel Tower. &nbsp;The next day,&nbsp;I took a tour organized by&nbsp;Amazon Eco Adventures&nbsp;Tours (<em>https://www.amazonecoadventures.com</em>) that visited&nbsp;the Meeting of Waters (where the dark Rio Negro and brown Amazon River meet a few miles down river from the city and then run side by side without mixing for nearly four miles), an indigenous village and an area frequented by pink Amazon river dolphins. &nbsp;On my final day,&nbsp;I headed to Mercado Adolpho Lisboa, where an enormous quantity and variety of fish from the Amazon basin were for sale. Since I was unable to find piranha on any menus, I purchased a toothy piranha (50&cent;) and had it grilled at one of the restaurants that surround the market ($1.25 to clean and grill). It tasted better than expected, but was bony and not very meaty, which is why the fearsome fish is inexpensive.</p>
",578
27,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I took an early&nbsp;morning flight from Bel&eacute;m&nbsp;to Macap&aacute;, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amap&aacute;, the only pair not covered by Lonely Planet, so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised that there weren&rsquo;t any other tourists. &nbsp;One of the benefits of a 40-minute flight that departed at 4:10 am was that I arrived early enough on the northern bank of the Amazon to watch the sunrise over the world&rsquo;s largest river. &nbsp;Macap&aacute;&rsquo;s only noteworthy site is S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; Fortress, built in 1764 by the Portuguese to guard the mouth of the Amazon.</p>
",577
28,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I visited&nbsp;Bel&eacute;m, the capital of the Brazilian state of Par&aacute;. &nbsp;The highlight is&nbsp;Ver-o-peso market, where enormous freshwater fish from the Amazon are sold. In the outdoor areas surrounding the gothic fish market, shopkeepers offer a&ccedil;a&iacute; berries, fruits and vegetables, and Brazil nuts, and at least one resplendent vendor was peddling love potions and get-rich-quick elixirs. &nbsp;My favorite places to eat were Remanso do Peixe, which specializes in freshwater fish from the Amazon basin, and&nbsp;Remanso do Bosque.</p>
",588
29,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I spent a couple of days in&nbsp;S&atilde;o Lu&iacute;s, the capital of the Brazilian state of Maranh&atilde;o. S&atilde;o Luis was settled by France in the early 17th century, the only city founded by that country in Brazil, and occupied briefly by the Dutch before being conquered by the Portuguese in the middle of the 17th&nbsp;century. The late 17th-century core of S&atilde;o Lu&iacute;s, where many of the buildings are covered with traditional azulejos tilework, is the best preserved Portuguese colonial city in Latin America, so no surprise it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites.</p>
",584
30,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I spent a morning wandering around the historic center of Fortaleza, the capital of the Brazilian state of Cear&aacute;. The rundown city center only contains a few colonial buildings, so it didn&rsquo;t take long to visit the several square blocks that have been preserved. That left me plenty of time to visit the city&rsquo;s beaches, for which it is understandably much better known. &nbsp;The best place to eat was&nbsp;Mercado Dos Peixes Av. Beira Mar, where dozens of vendors sell seafood to be prepared at nearby stalls, followed by ice cream a short walk away at 50 Sabores (<em>http://www.50sabores.com.br</em>).</p>
",580
31,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I took a morning bus to Piren&oacute;polis, a colonial and Art Deco town in the Brazilian state of Goi&aacute;s. Piren&oacute;polis was founded by the Portuguese in 1727 and discovered by the counterculture in the 1980s, so now offers one-stop shopping for crystals, feathered dreamcatchers, batik clothing and all the accoutrements and paraphernalia that hippies worldwide consider essential.</p>
",583
32,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I visited Palmas, the capital of the newest Brazilian state of Tocantins, formed in 1988 from the northern half of its now southern neighbor. Palmas was created in 1990 out of an uninhabited agricultural region, and is now a soulless urban center, known, if at all, for two things. First, Palmas is supposedly the hottest city in Brazil, although the temperature only reached 91&deg;F during my visit. Second, the main public square, Pra&ccedil;a dos Girass&oacute;is, or Sunflower Square, is the world&rsquo;s fourth largest city square, but perhaps the least visited. &nbsp;Best was the lunch at Dom Verg&iacute;lio (<em>http://www.domvergilio.com.br/site/</em>).</p>
",601
33,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I spent a few days in&nbsp;Bras&iacute;lia, which was&nbsp;founded <em>ex nihilo</em> in 1960 to move the three branches of government from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. &nbsp;The city was built on&nbsp;a grand scale, more for automobiles than pedestrians, so&nbsp;I hired a guide (www.<em>guiajuanluishermida.com.br</em>) to visit the&nbsp;modernist civic buildings designed by&nbsp;Oscar Niemeyer. &nbsp;Atheist Oscar Niemeyer achieved the apotheosis of his nearly eight-decade architectural career with the Cathedral of Bras&iacute;lia, which was completed in 1970, a dozen years after its cornerstone was laid in 1958. In 1990, the cathedral&rsquo;s outer roof was lined with stained glass, now filling the ineffable place of worship with color and light.</p>
",581
34,111,"<p>August 2018 -- I spent a couple of days in&nbsp;Belo Horizonte, the capital of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. In 1936, the mayor of Belo Horizante dammed a small stream to create a reservoir. &nbsp;The resulting Lake Pampulha became the site of an urban development project designed by Oscar Niemeyer, who would later become famous as the architect of Bras&iacute;lia, the planned city that became Brazil&#39;s capital in 1960. &nbsp;On my first day in Belo Horizonte, I followed the&nbsp;path around the man made lake to visit the four 1940s-era buildings --&nbsp;an uninspiring former casino, ballroom, yacht club and church -- that&nbsp;were inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites as the Pampulha Modern Ensemble. &nbsp;On my second day,&nbsp;I took an early morning bus to Ouro Preto, a colonial-era town constructed during Brazil&rsquo;s gold-mining area in the 18th century while under Portuguese rule, where&nbsp;I spent the day wandering its cobblestoned center, dotted with Baroque churches built with wealth from Brazil&rsquo;s gold rush. After the gold boom, Ouro Preto was economically isolated for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, which helped preserve its historic buildings and urban pattern. &nbsp;I had lunch at Casa do Ouvidor, which has been serving&nbsp;<em>comida mineira </em>since 1972 (<em>http://www.casadoouvidor.com.br</em>). &nbsp;Ouro Preto was deservedly inscribed as Brazil&rsquo;s first World Heritage Site in 1980.</p>

35,111,"<p>August 2018 --&nbsp;I visited&nbsp;Vit&oacute;ria, the capital of the Brazilian state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo. The city was founded on Brazil&rsquo;s southeastern coast in the sixteenth century, although very few colonial buildings remain in its city center. By late morning, I had visited the safe part of the historic area so made my way to Praia de Camburi, the city&rsquo;s longest beach.</p>

36,111,"July 2018 -- I spent five days on Christmas Island, famous for its tens of millions of red crabs, which migrate from the forests to the coast during the wet season. The two other most noticeable crabs are robber crabs, the largest land crab in the world, and blue crabs, which were only recognized as a new species a few years ago. The best place to see crabs is along the many trails in Christmas Island National Park, which covers most of the island and protects the world’s most prodigious and diverse population of land crabs. The endemic red crabs were ubiquitous, although many were hidden in burrows or buried beneath leaf litter or underground, awaiting the rainy season to swarm to the sea to breed and release billions of eggs into the ocean.<br><br>The isolated island is also home to some rare endemic invertebrates, including Christmas Island blue-tailed skinks. The tiny lizards, decimated since the 1990s by invasive snakes, ants and centipedes, have become extinct in the wild.  I made arrangements to visit the Pink House Research Station, ordinarily closed but for one day each week to the public, to learn more about their efforts to breed the iridescent rainbow-hued reptiles, which have increased the total population from the two dozen originally removed from the wild to the thousand or so now in captivity.<br><br>I spent my final day at Dolly Beach, the island’s largest and most secluded and annually ranked as one of Australia’s top ten beaches. The beach is reached after a long trek through the rainforest, so was deserted, except for an abundance of robber crabs, elsewhere known as coconut crabs, feeding on their favorite food.",451
37,111,"July 2018 -- Due to a flight disruption, what had been planned as a four-day visit to Cocos (Keeling) Islands was reduced to two days.  So, I spent my time on West Island, one of two inhabited atolls in Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The small archipelago’s distance from the mainland (more than 1,800 miles from Perth, so midway between Australia and Sri Lanka), small population (less than six hundred) and infrequent flights (only two weekly flights from Perth) mean the atoll was largely deserted, so I had to myself the picture-perfect, tropical-island beaches, lined with the abundant coconut trees that give the territory its name.  I stayed at Cocos Village Bungalows (http://cocosvillagebungalows.com) and was able to arrange for a scooter from the very helpful, nearby tourism office.",452
38,111,"July 2018 -- I made a day trip by ferry from Xiamen to Gulangyu, a pedestrian-only island that was established as an international settlement in 1903 and added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 2017.",625
39,111,"July 2018 -- I visited Fremantle, which has been recognized as the best-preserved 19th-century port streetscape in the world for its more than 250 convict-built and gold rush-era sandstone buildings.  But, more interesting to me is that Fremantle was the hometown of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC from October 1974 until his February 1980 death, who has been honored by the city with a bronze statue that depicts him on a Marshall amplifier.  I made a day trip from Perth to Rottnest Island, around eleven miles off the coast of western Australia.  When Dutch sailors landed on the uninhabited island in the seventeenth century, it was populated by thousands of small mammals that looked like large rats, hence the name that means Rats' Nest Island.  Today, Rottnest Island is the best place to see those marsupials, known as quokkas.  I ended my trip with a couple of days in Perth, where I visited the Art Gallery of Western Australia and the Perth Zoo.",81
40,111,"July 2018 -- I spent a few days at the Jungle Inn (http://www.jungleinnbukitlawang.com) in Bukit Lawang, the gateway to Gunung Leuser National Park, probably the best place to see Sumatran orangutans, where I went hiking in the national park and saw more than a dozen orangutans over both days, ranging from an infant being carried by its mother to a large male.",550
41,111,"June 2018 -- I spent a few days in Dakar, where I caught an early morning ferry to Île de Gorée, which, at least according to UNESCO, was the largest slave-trading center on the African coast from the 15th century to abolition in the 19th century.  Although many historians disagree with that assessment, Île de Gorée has become an essential stop for the African diaspora, including President and Mrs. Obama, who visited the Maison des Esclaves and its windowless cells and “door of no return” in 2013.  I spent another day wandering around Plateau, the historic center of Dakar.  The Senegalese capital was a major city in the French colonial empire, but very few buildings have survived from the period when the westernmost city on the mainland of Africa served as the capital of French West Africa.  The few remaining colonial-era structures include the statue of DuPont and Demba, which stands in front of the colonial railway station and is dedicated to the Senegalese soldiers who fought in World War I; Hôtel de Ville; Chambre de Commerce, built in 1910; and Marché Kermel, built in 1860, although it burned down in 1994 and was faithfully reconstructed three years later.  My favorite places to eat were Chez Loutcha, probably the best restaurant for Senegalese cuisine, and Le Lagon, which has been serving seafood from its seaside location for more than 60 years, and to drink were Le Viking, the city center's best traditional pub, and Le Bideew, the cafe in the gardens of the Institut Français Léopold Sédar Senghor.  I made some sightseeing arrangements with Andaando Travel (http://www.andaando.com).",406
42,111,"June 2018 -- Having spent five days in The Gambia in early June 2018, it’s easy to appreciate why the smallest nation on the African continent has been nicknamed “The Smiling Coast of Africa.” I organized two full-day tours with Arch Tours (http://arch-tours.com). Since I traveled during shoulder season, I wasn't able to join group tours, so Arch Tours graciously charged me the same price for an individual tour as I would have paid for a group tour -- and traveling in June allowed me to have each site to myself. Each tour company runs a variation of a tour to visit several sites in one day. On Arch's ""Four Tours in One Day,"" I visited Serekunda Market, the country's largest (although I later visited Albert Market in Banjul, which seems just as large, better organized and more photogenic); Kachikally Crocodile Pool, a popular destination for women struggling with getting pregnant, who come from around The Gambia to douse themselves in its supposedly curative water; Abuko Livestock Market, the largest cattle, sheep and goat market in The Gambia; and a fishing beach, where the daily catch is smoked or salted under the hot sun.<br><br>In 1976, Alex Haley published <i>Roots: The Saga of an American Family</i>, where he traces his genealogy back to Kunta Kinte and The Gambia. According to Haley, Kunta Kinte was born around 1750 in the village of Jufureh on the north bank of the River Gambia. Since the success of the 1977 miniseries, Jufureh has become one of The Gambia’s primary tourist destinations. During my visit, the local guide basically recited as fact the somewhat fictional plot of <i>Roots</i> and shared the stories of his “ancestors” Fiddler, Kizzy and Chicken George. I also met the family matriarch, claiming to be a distant cousin of Alex Haley, who met with him during his first visit to Jufureh in 1967.  From Jufureh, I traveled to the river and hired a pirogue, a long wooden boat, to reach James Island, which was used by the British in the slave trade. According to <i>Roots</i>, Kunta Kinte was among nearly a hundred slaves brought from James Island to Annapolis by the slave ship Lord Ligonier in 1767. The island was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2003 and renamed Kunta Kinte Island in 2011.<br><br>I stayed at Luigi&#8242;s Complex (http://www.luigis.gm), which is much nicer and personal than any of the large hotels on or near the touristy Senegambia Strip -- but is only a $0.15 bush taxi ride from the strip.",377
43,111,"June 2018 -- I visited Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, including the statue of Amílcar Cabral, who led the nationalist movement of Guinea-Bissau and the ensuing war of independence; the large, black fist monument that commemorates the Pidjiguiti massacre, when police shot at Bissau dockworkers, killing 50 and injuring more than 100 stevedores in 1959; and Fortaleza de São José da Amura, which houses Cabral's mausoleum.  I stayed at Coimbra Hotel, well located in the city center.",381
44,111,"December 2017 -- I left Islamabad on the Grand Trunk Road to Taxila, an hour to the northwest, to visit its ruined second-century Buddhist monastery.  From Taxila, it was a two-hour drive to Takht-i-Bahi, another Buddhist monastery, which was abandoned in the seventh century.  I ended the day in Peshawar, where I visited the 17th-century Mahabat Khan Mosque and Qissa Khawani Bazaar.",824
45,111,"December 2017 -- I visited Faisal Mosque, the largest mosque in Pakistan (as well as the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993).",823
46,111,"December 2017 -- I visited Lahore’s mosques, fort and other monuments built during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when Pakistan’s current second largest city was part of the Mughal Empire.  The highlights were Badshahi Mosque, the largest grand imperial Mughal-era mosque, and Wazir Khan Mosque, the most ornately decorated mosque from the same period.  I stayed at Faletti's Hotel, which opened in 1880 (http://falettishotel.com).  I also visited Rohtas Fort, a garrison fort known as an exceptional example of Islamic military architecture, and  Taxila, both of which are World Heritage Sites.",825
47,111,"December 2017 -- I began my trip in Karachi, where my first stop was Mazar-e-Quaid, the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and then spent an afternoon tracing the colonial buildings from the British Raj era, such as the Empress Market, where the poultry section was openly selling endangered birds, Frere Hall, built in 1865 as the city’s first town hall, and Karachi Cantonment railway station.  I made a day trip to Makli Necropolis, about 60 miles east of Karachi, which might be the world’s largest funerary site -- the ten square kilometer burial ground contains approximately one million tombs, mostly built between 1570 and 1640.  While on the way to and from Makli, I visited three locations on Pakistan's list of tentative World Heritage Sites: Chaukhandi Tombs, an early Islamic cemetery; Shah Jahan Mosque, a 17th-century mosque known for its geometric tile and brickwork; and the Port of Banbhore, an ancient city dating to the 1st century BCE.  I made my arrangements with Travel & Culture Services (https://travel-culture.com).",826
48,111,"November 2017 -- I only spent a brief time in Niamey, where I visited Musée National Boubou Hama, the country’s national museum and abysmal zoo, and the Niamey Grand Market.  In Niamey, I stayed at the Grand Hôtel du Niger (http://www.grandhotelniger.com), well located overlooking the Niger River, and my favorite place to eat was le Pilier, a surprisingly good Italian restaurant given its location (http://www.lepilierrestaurant.com).  From Niamey, it was a few hour drive to Parc National du W, where wildlife was widely scattered and difficult to see through the thick brush  -- the most common animals were several species of antelope, including roan, oribi, western hartebeest and waterbuck, but I also saw a few elephants, African buffalos and crocodiles.  I also visited Kouré Giraffe Reserve, about an hour east of Niamey, home to the last self-sustaining herd of West African giraffes.",397
49,111,"November 2017 -- I began and ended my trip in Ouagadougou, but didn't spend too much time in the capital because there is very little to see.  I spent an hour or so in the Marché Rood Wooko, the main market, but it’s not one of West Africa’s more interesting markets. The capital's few other sites include the Place de Cinéastes roundabout, where the central monument pays tribute to the filmmakers who participate in the biennial Panafrican Film and Television Festival, the continent’s most prestigious, and a few religious buildings like the large mosque and church.  I stayed at Princess Yenenga Lodge, a short walk from the city center (http://www.princessyenengalodge.com), and my best (well, only) meal outside the hotel was at the now highly secure Cappuccino, which was targeted in the January 2016 terrorist attack.<br><br>I spent most of my time in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country’s second largest city, which is much more appealing than Ouagadougou. The most vibrant area is around the Grand Marché, the atmospheric market, where all the typical foodstuffs, colorful textiles and household goods are on offer; stranger fare was available on the outskirts in the fetish section.  Bobo-Dioulasso’s highlight is the Grand Mosquée, made of mud with timber struts that peek through the walls and minarets.  In Bobo, I stayed at Villa Rose (http://villarosebobodioulasso.com/en/).  On the return drive to Ouagadougou, I visited the sacred crocodile lakes at Sabou and Bazoule — pictures with the cold-blooded reptiles are encouraged.",361
50,111,"November 2017 -- I made a day trip from Paris to Château de Chenonceau, Château de Cheverny and Château de Chambord, three of the most architecturally distinct Châteaux of the Loire Valley.",861
51,111,"October 2017 -- I visited Mendoza, the center of Argentina’s winemaking industry, which is known for some of the best, yet inexpensive, Malbecs.  I also visited several vineyards in Luján de Cuyo in the upper Mendoza valley -- what sets Luján de Cuyo apart from the world’s other great viticultural regions is the spectacular view of the Andes over the vineyards.",762
52,111,"October 2017 -- I spent a morning in San Juan, where, for the first time during my fortnight in Argentina, I encountered memorials to victims of the Holocaust and to those killed in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) War.  I translated as I was best able the information at the Holocaust memorial, and I’m fairly confident that there wasn’t any mention that Argentina was the primary destination for senior Nazis fleeing Europe via so-called “ratlines.”  In the aftermath of the war, SS officers like Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele found easy passage via the ratlines to Argentina.  I also visited the city's dinosaur museum, which focuses on Ischigualasto Provincial Park.",767
53,111,"October 2017 -- Since my plan was to cover more than 450 miles from Córdoba, in central Argentina, to San Juan in the West, I set out on the 6:30 am bus from Córdoba, arriving after 7½ hours in San Luis, the capital of the province of the same name.  I was able to confirm my guidebook’s opinion that San Luis has little to offer visitors, likely the reason I was the only obvious tourist in town, but it was a pleasant enough place to break the trip and while away a few hours before my 4-hour bus ride to San Juan.",768
54,111,"October 2017 -- I made the one-hour trip by minibus from Córdoba to Alta Gracia, which is famous for two things — its World Heritage-inscribed Jesuit estancia and the boyhood home of the world’s most famous revolutionary, Che Guevara.  In Córdoba, I visited the Museo de la Memoria in Córdoba, which occupies a building formerly used during the decade from 1974 to 1983 to torture and kill those opposed to the government and to “reassign” their children to more politically compliant families.  Several walls of the museum are covered with hundreds of photos of those who were disappeared after being taken to the Córdoba secret prison.  Visitors can also step inside the tiny cells, maybe a yard across, where some prisoners were held for several years.  My favorite restaurant was La Parrilla de Raul Ferreira 1906, which has been serving parrilla for more than a century.",755
55,111,"October 2017 -- I made the three-hour bus ride from La Rioja to Talampaya National Park, which was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to its important archaeological and palaeontological sites. The best part of the trip was being able to ride on the roof of the truck as we drove down a dry riverbed through a vertiginous red sandstone canyon searching for 1500-year old petroglyphs (several), wildlife (not much) and unusual stone formations (plenty), some of which are enormous.",761
56,111,"October 2017 -- I made the four-hour bus ride from Santiago del Estero to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, which is home to one of Argentina’s main religious pilgrimage sites.  I joined the queue of pilgrims, many infirm, at the Church of the Virgin of the Valley, which contains a small statue of Our Lady of the Valley.  The faithful claim that over more than four centuries of worship, the statue has healed terminal illnesses, cured the blind and reversed paralysis — as a demonstration of gratitude, the pilgrims donate miniature metal models of their healed body parts, which are displayed on the walls of the shrine.",752
57,111,"October 2017 -- I made the two-hour bus ride from San Miguel de Tucumán to Santiago del Estero, nicknamed the Mother of Cities since it was the first city established by the Spanish in Argentina.  But, that’s not enough to attract overseas visitors, as I learned from the enthusiastic reception I received in the tourist office.  According to the manager, I was their first visitor from New York (and he couldn’t recall any other American visitors), so he insisted on taking my photo for promotional use in front of what was essentially a “Welcome to Santiago del Estero” sign.  Santiagueños are known for long siestas, generally from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, so the museum that I planned to visit was closed.  But, when I made it known that I was departing on a 6:00 pm bus, I was permitted to enter the dinosaur exhibit at the Centro Cultural del Bicentenario before it reopened.  Such was the hospitality I received in a small provincial capital.",771
58,111,"October 2017 -- I made the four-hour bus trip from Salta to San Miguel de Tucumán, which is famous for two things.  First, Argentina declared its independence from Spain in Tucumán in July 1816 in Casa Histórica de la Independencia, which is one of the city’s many historical buildings. Second, and more appealing to me, Tucumán is even more well known for some of the country’s best empanadas, which is how I found myself early one morning at the counter of a market stall in Mercado del Norte with a breakfast of beef empanadas and roasted potatoes.",773
59,111,"October 2017 -- I traveled by bus from San Salvador de Jujuy to Salta to visit the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology.  In 1999, three Incan child mummies were discovered near the 22,000 ft summit of an Andean dormant volcano, each of whom had been drugged, allowed to freeze to death and entombed in a small stone chamber.  The best preserved Incan mummies ever discovered have been nicknamed la doncella (the maiden), la niña del rayo (the lightning girl) and el niño (the boy), and are rotated so only one is displayed at a time -- el niño was exhibited during my visit.",766
60,111,"October 2017 -- I made a day trip by bus from San Salvador de Jujuy to Humahuaca, which traveled most of the length of Quebrada de Humahuaca, a narrow mountain valley in northwestern Argentina that has been populated for more than ten millennia, ever since the first hunter-gatherers, but the few remaining historical sites are difficult to reach, widely scattered and not very interesting.",759
61,111,"October 2017 -- I spent a few days at Península Valdés, probably the best place on the South American mainland to see marine wildlife, where I saw nesting Magellanic penguins (the penguins were generally indifferent to visitors and waddled to within a few feet of me, often too close for photography), southern right whales (which visit the warm waters surrounding the peninsula between May and December to mate and give birth), guanacos, rheas and Patagonian mara.  But the best wildlife viewing was around 50 miles from Puerto Madryn at Punta Ninfas, where my guide and I climbed down 300 ft cliffs to a rocky beach that’s home to several breeding harems of southern elephant seals.  Due to the tricky descent, the beach doesn’t receive many visitors, and I was the only visitor during my three-hour stay.  In addition to the elephant seals, I was lucky to see several killer whales patrolling the coastline, but they didn’t attempt to capture any of the baby seals resting along the shoreline — the area is famous for orcas that employ this unique hunting style.  I visited the peninsula and Punta Ninfas with Marcos from Catalejo Travel (http://catalejotravel.wixsite.com/catalejotravel) -- he was one of the best naturalists that I have encountered.",754
62,111,"September 2017 -- I traveled by ferry from Turku to Mariehamn, the capital of the Åland Islands. Åland, an autonomous territory under Finnish sovereignty, is not part of the EU tax union, which enables duty free sales onboard the ferries.  So nearly all of the passengers made the 5½-hour trip to purchase tobacco and liquor, and, after arriving, they joined another ferry that was immediately returning to Turku.  Only a few passengers disembarked in Mariehamn.  In 2004, a dozen Scandinavian chefs put out the Nordic kitchen manifesto, which essentially launched Nordic cuisine onto the global stage.  I had lunch at Smakbyns, the restaurant founded by Michael Björklund, one of the original twelve signatories to the Nordic kitchen manifesto.  As part of the weekend's Åland Harvest Festival, restaurants featured the bounty from local farms and the sea, and Smakbyns set out a long buffet of local dishes, where the most surprising was braised cormorant, a large seabird.",236
63,111,"September 2017 -- I made a day trip from Moscow by train to Kaluga to visit the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics, which was opened in 1967 as the first museum focused on space exploration.  The museum is named after Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, an autodidactic recluse, who spent his adult life in the late 19th and early 20th-centuries in a log cabin on the outskirts of Kaluga, where he modeled space flight and calculated formulas that space agencies continue to use to launch rockets and put satellites into orbit.",700
64,111,"September 2017 -- I made a day trip by train from Moscow to Tula, about 120 miles to the capital's south, to visit the Tula State Museum of Weapons and the 16th-century Tula Kremlin, where the highlight is the 18th-century Assumption Cathedral, topped by five golden onion domes.",729
65,111,"September 2017 --  I took an early morning train to Sergiyev Posad to visit the 14th-century Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, Russia's most important monastery and the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church.  The World Heritage Site may be the most popular day trip from Moscow, so, even though I caught the first train, I didn't arrive early enough to avoid scores of buses each unloading dozens of tourists.",710
66,111,"September 2017 --  I visited Vladimir, one of Russia's medieval capitals and now known for its three 12th-century buildings that have been inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city's highlight is the Assumption Cathedral, which was Russia's main Orthodox church in the 14th century. The other World Heritage Sites are the Golden Gate, Russia's only preserved ancient city gate, and the single-domed Cathedral of Saint Demetrius.",694
67,111,"September 2017 -- I traveled by high-speed train from Moscow to Tver, which was founded in the 12th century at the confluence of the Volga and Tvertsa rivers. In the 18th century, Tver became the main station on the highway between Moscow and St. Petersburg, and during the reign of Catherine the Great the river city was rebuilt in a neoclassical style.  Like other Russian cities, Tver's historical center is dotted with lifelike statues, including a statue of Afanasy Nikitin, a local merchant who, in the 15th century, became the first Russian to make the long overland journey to India. According to a local legend, during a visit by Soviet Premier Khrushchev to India, Prime Minister Nehru asked him if Nikitin had been honored with a statue. To avoid embarrassment, Khrushchev lied and told Nehru that a statue of Nikitin had, contrary to fact, been erected in Tver, his hometown -- and then ordered that a statue be constructed before Nehru's state visit to the Soviet Union.",727
68,111,"September 2017 -- I spent a few days in Kaliningrad, where the most interesting sites were the Museum of the World Ocean, the world's only museum solely devoted to deep-sea exploration, which displays submersibles, a Bathysphere and Russia's only pre-atomic submarine, and the Kaliningrad Zoo, which was established in 1896 as the Königsberger Tiergarten.  My favorite place to eat was the restaurant inside Kinoteatr Zarja, the city's oldest cinema, where the lobby features a bronze hand-and-eyeglasses tribute to Woody Allen (who, like the city, started out named Konigsberg).<br><br>I made a day trip from Kaliningrad to the Curonian Spit, a long, narrow sand-dune peninsula shared by Russia and Lithuania.  Even though the Curonian Spit is home to Europe's highest drifting sand dunes, some topping 200 feet, the spit's most popular attraction is a small woodland of bent and twisted pine trees euphemistically called the Dancing Forest.  Although the precise cause of the arboreal deformity isn't known, one theory suggests that World War II-era mustard gas contaminated the soil and corrupted the trees' genetic code.  I organized my trip to the Corunian Spit with Alexey (http://www.sambiatrip.ru).",283
69,111,"August 2017 -- I flew from Guangzhou to Haikou on Hainan Island, the largest island under China's control. (Taiwan is slightly larger than Hainan but is not under Chinese control.) Most visitors to Hainan Island, known as the Hawaii of China, head to the beaches around Sanya on the southern coast, usually skipping Haikou, to their disservice. I spent an afternoon in Haikou's old town, the country's most impressive example of arcade architecture. The century-old streets are lined with qilous, arcade houses that blend European and Asian architecture with Indian and Arab influences. The ground floors of the two to four-story qilous are set back so a row of arcades sheltered from the sun and inclement weather is formed.  <br><br>I traveled by high-speed train from Haikou, located on the northern coast of Hainan Island, to Sanya, one of China's southernmost cities. I visited Phoenix Island, an artificial archipelago whose cluster of white edifices has earned it the sobriquet the Oriental Dubai.  Only one of the two islands has been completed, and since many of the apartments are owned by wealthy mainland Chinese, overseas Russians and Hongkongers, and because the island is generally only open to residents and their guests, the island was eerily empty and I was the lone diner at lunch.<br><br>My favorite meals were at Ban Qiao Road Seafood Market in Haiku and No. 1 Agricultural Products Market in Sanya, where market stalls sells an aquarium's worth of sea creatures, which are then prepared at any of several dozen nearby restaurants. In both markets, I visited a few vendors offering exotic underwater denizens before purchasing some odd cephalopods and a few unusual molluscs, as well as some Chinese vegetables, which were turned into excellent dinners at local restaurants.",494
70,111,"August 2017 -- I made a day trip from Chongqing to Dazu to visit the Baodingshan section of the Dazu Rock Carvings, a mile-long, open limestone outcropping following an oxbow that during the 12th and 13th centuries was carved into 6,000 rock reliefs and sculptures depicting Buddhist and Taoist themes. The well-preserved carvings, reachable by a two-hour public bus ride from Chongqing, were only opened to foreign visitors in 1980 and added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1999.  My favorite meal in Chongqing was hot pot at Mang Hot Pot, a basement hole-in-the-wall known for some of Chongqing's spiciest hotpot.",677
71,111,"August 2017 -- The Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet was the residence of the Dalai Lama from the 17th century until the current Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising.  During the Cultural Revolution, Tibet's monasteries were destroyed with dynamite and artillery and rare books and paintings were burned. By the end of the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of Tibet's 6,000 religious monasteries, temples and shrines had been looted, damaged or destroyed. Yet, Zhou Enlai, China's then Premier, personally intervened to ensure that the Potola Palace was not destroyed.  I also visited Norbulingka, the traditional summer residence of successive Dalai Lamas from the 18th century until the current Dalai Lama exiled in 1959, and Chagpo Ri Rock Carvings, where more than 5,000 painted rock carvings of Buddhist images have been created over a millennium.  I stayed at House of Shambhala in Lhasa's old town (http://www.shambhalaserai.com/html/House-of-shambhala-1.html), and my favorite meal was yak steak at Tibet Steak House.  I made my arrangements with Explore Tibet (http://www.exploretibet.com).",555
72,111,"August 2017 -- I made a day trip today from Chengdu to Leshan, which sits at the confluence of three rivers, the Minjiang, Dadu and Qingyi in the southern part of Sichuan province. Leshan Giant Buddha was carved out of a cliff facing the confluence in the eighth century. At 233 ft, it is the tallest stone Buddha statue in the world, but even more impressive is that it's the tallest pre-modern statue in the world. A monk initiated its construction as a plea to Buddha to quiet the tempestuous waters at the confluence. Either Buddha did so, or all of the rocks and debris that tumbled into the river during the statue's construction stilled the waters, since the confluence has been safely navigable since the completion of the statue.  I made another day trip (organized by Sichuan Travel Guide; http://www.sichuantravelguide.com) from Chengdu to Gengda Wolong Panda Center, one of several areas created to protect giant pandas and inscribed as the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries on the list of World Heritage Sites. The panda center was originally established in Wolong in June 1980, but a catastrophic earthquake devastated the region in May 2008. The center has since reopened a few miles from its original location.  On my final day in Chengdu, I visited the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, the global center for studying and breeding giant pandas. The center also researches the unfortunately named red panda, which is not closely related to the giant panda, but, by virtue of nomenclature, is destined to be the lesser panda (another of its names).  My final stop was at Chengdu Museum, which exhibits the world's largest collection of Chinese shadow puppets. For shadow play, a puppeteer places the flat articulated shadow puppets between a light source and a translucent screen and can appear to animate the puppets by moving the light or the puppets.  My favorite meals in Chengdu were the signature dishes at Lao Ma Rabbit Head Restaurant and Chen Mapo Tofu.",642
73,111,"August 2017 -- I visited Dunhuang in northwestern China, a major stop on the Silk Road. Dunhuang is situated in an oasis containing Crescent Lake and Singing-Sand Mountain, named after the sound of the wind rushing off the dunes, the so-called singing sand phenomenon. I visited the lake and mountain in the afternoon during the hottest part of the day because I wanted to avoid the crowds that overrun the site at sunset.  Dunhuang's most well-known dishes are yellow noodles topped with cold, sliced donkey meat and tofu sauce, and Silk Road-style camel hoof. Since my hunch, later confirmed, was that I wouldn't find English-speaking waitstaff or translated menus in the night market, my plan was to photograph a donkey and a camel, show them at the restaurant and hope for recognition. It worked and I was able to dine on a starter of donkey-meat noodles followed by tangy camel hoof. The main reason for my trip to Dunhuang, which is distant from everywhere in China, was to visit Mogao Caves, the best known of China's Buddhist grottoes. The caves were hewn into a two-kilometer long cliff over the millennium from the fourth until the 14th century by monks to serve as shrines. During the Ming Dynasty, sea trade replaced the Silk Road and Dunhuang and the caves were largely abandoned, until rediscovered by western explorers in the late 19th century. It's what's inside the caves that has earned Mogao its well-deserved inscription on the list of World Heritage Sites. The walls of many of the 487 temple grottoes are covered from floor to ceiling with murals of Buddhist and traditional mythical subjects and many of the grottoes contain brightly-painted clay sculptures of Buddha and notable Buddhist figures, including one statue of Buddha that was created more than a thousand years ago in 695 AD and rises to 116 feet.",626
74,111,"August 2017 -- I visited Kashgar, the westernmost city in China and located near the country's borders with Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. Even though Kashgar is farther from Beijing than New York is from Los Angeles, the city operates on Beijing time, just like the rest of China, despite the nation spanning five geographical time zones. So, I was able to enjoy long days since the sun set around 10:07 pm, nearly three hours later than it did in Beijing.  Unlike most of China, which is substantially Han Chinese, Kashgar's population is mostly Muslim Uyghurs. In that way, Kashgar has more in common with its Central Asian neighbors, like the predominance of Islam, the use of Arabic script, the style of clothing, arts and cuisine, let alone the appearance of the local population, than it does with the rest of China. All of these characteristics combine to make Kashgar one of the most interesting destinations in China.",563
75,111,"August 2017 -- I made a day trip from Xi'an to Luoyang by high-speed train that covered the 230 miles between the two cities, about the same distance from New York to Washington, D.C., in 80 minutes. My first stop was Longmen Grottoes, where the 2,345 hand-carved caves and alcoves contain more than 100,000 statues of Buddha and his disciples. The grottoes were excavated over the period from 493 AD to 1127 AD with Buddhist subjects, which range in size from less than an inch to the largest Buddha statue that reaches 57 feet in height.  I also visited Shaolin Monastery, where Shaolin kung fu, one of the oldest and most famous styles of Chinese martial arts, was developed. Shaolin Monastery and its pagoda forest are World Heritage Sites, but most of the visitors arrive to see the kung fu performance by the Shaolin Temple Martial Arts Troupe, where students perform all sorts of stunts, like balancing upon the sharpened prong of a trident and using the throat to push and bend spears.",631
76,111,"July 2017 -- Irkutsk's unique wooden baroque architecture is a mixture of elements from Eastern European Orthodoxy with Buryat Shamanism and Buddhist traditions. One of the distinctive features of the wooden houses is the use of shutters in reaction to Siberia's historical high crime rate since it was thought that the shutters would act as an additional security barrier. Largely due to the abundance of wooden homes, Irkutsk is one of the most architecturally distinct cities that I have visited.<br><br>I took a marshrutka to Listvyanka, on the southwestern shore of Lake Baikal, from Irkutsk, for only $1.68 for the 43-mile trip. I don't have an interest in limnology, the study of inland waters, but it was nonetheless worth visiting the Baikal Limnological Museum, where I learned why Baikal is the world's most impressive lake. Baikal is the largest freshwater lake by volume, holding one fifth of all unfrozen fresh water, or more than the total contained in all five Great Lakes. Baikal is also the deepest, clearest and oldest lake.  More than 80% of Baikal's animals are found nowhere else, and include the Baikal seal, the only exclusively freshwater pinniped. The seals mainly survive on golomyanka, translucent fish that are the deepest living freshwater fish.  Listvyanka market has a large section selling smoked fish, including smoked golomyanka. The sensation of an incredibly fatty and oily fish, served whole from head to fishtail, exploding in my mouth was somewhat offputting. Unlike the seals, I stopped after one golomyanka.  I also visited Siberia Zoo, where I was allowed to enter the enclosure with the foxes and juvenile wolf.",699
77,111,"July 2017 -- I visited Yakutsk, a remote city in Eastern Siberia that can convincingly claim to be the coldest city on earth. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yakutsk was &#8722;83.9 °F in February 1891, one of the coldest temperatures ever recorded outside Antarctica, and the city has never reported a temperature above freezing between mid-November and mid-March.  Some of the survival skills in such an extreme environment are mind boggling -- for example, children attend school unless the thermometer plummets to &#8722;67 °F, although kindergarteners are treated more gently and get the day off if the temperature only drops to &#8722;58 °F.<br><br>Yakutsk, like many Russian cities, has a prominently-located Lenin statue. But in this case there's a connection between the two since it's believed that Vladimir Ulyanov, at 31, changed his name to Lenin after the Lena River, which flows through Yakutsk.<br><br>In May 2013, paleontologists from North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk excavated an almost complete mammoth, with three legs, most of the body, part of the head and an intact trunk. This creature, now held in a cryogenic vault in the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory at the university, is the best-preserved specimen of a woolly mammoth in the history of paleontology.  I made special arrangements not only for a tour of the museum, but also to access the cryogenic vault where I was able to hold a leg and tusk of the world's best-preserved woolly mammoth.  Yakutsk, the largest city in the world built on permafrost, is home to Russia's only scientific institute devoted to the study of permafrost, the Melnikov Permafrost Institute. The institution studies the thermal and mechanical interactions between engineering structures and permafrost, especially useful in Yakutsk where every building sits on stilts sunk into the permafrost. The permafrost around Yakutsk reaches a depth of 1,493 m (4,898 ft), making it the deepest in the world. Along with academics from the local university, I joined a tour that only descended to 15 meters.<br><br>My favorite meal was at Chochur Muran, which looks like a Siberian hunting lodge and is probably the best restaurant in Yakutsk for Sakha delicacies. I started with stroganina, frozen raw chyr, a white fish common in Arctic rivers. The trick is that the frozen chyr must not melt until it's inside your mouth. I followed that with horse rib steak.",540
78,111,"July 2017 -- I visited Vladivostok, the main Russian naval base on the Pacific. Until 1992, that would have been impossible. In 1948, the Soviets closed Vladivostok to foreigners and filled the surrounding area with tanks, soldiers, warplanes, checkpoints and listening devices. I stayed at Hotel Versailles, the city's oldest hotel (http://hotel-versailles.ru), in the extraordinarily attractive city center, which is jam-packed with ornately carved buildings. Maybe more than four decades as a ""closed city"" helped preserve the city's architectural richness.  In July 1920, Yuliy Borisovich Briner was born in Vladivostok, but didn't become world famous until after he had changed his name to Yul Brynner (and after he had shaved his head). In 2012, the city erected a statue of Brynner in front of his birthplace, just around the corner from Hotel Versailles. Yul's statue shows him in his most famous role in the King and I as King Mongkut.<br><br>Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by his alias, said that ""Vladivostok is far away, but it is ours” in a speech after the unification of the short-lived Far Eastern Republic with the rest of the Soviet Union. A Lenin statue looms over Vladivostok's railway station, the terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, 5,772 miles from Moscow, a journey that takes more than six days. Since the statue is pointing to Japan, locals joke that Lenin is informing his comrades that they are heading in the right direction. I attended an exhibit on Lenin at the Arsenyev Regional History Museum.<br><br>I visited Primorsky Aquarium, which has been designed to look like a seashell. It is one of the best aquariums that I have visited, not only for its clever design, but also since it focuses on denizens of Russia's water zones, such as the Seas of Japan and Okhotsk, the Amur River and Lake Baikal, instead of only displaying the ocean's greatest hits, as many aquariums do.  Primorsky Aquarium is located on Russky Island, which was militarised for most of the past 150 years and only opened to foreigners in the early 2000s.",685
79,111,"July 2017 -- I made a day trip from Harbin to Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, by high-speed train, which covered the 175 miles between the two provincial capitals in an hour. Changchun is one of China's least interesting provincial capitals, but that current assessment belies its historical importance as the capital of the Japanese puppet state Manchuria from 1932 to 1945. Changchun's highlight is the Museum of the Imperial Palace of the Manchu State, formerly the residence created by the Imperial Japanese Army for Puyi, China's last emperor, during his time as Emperor of Manchuria.",636
80,111,"July 2017 -- I visited the Siberian Tiger Park on the outskirts of Harbin, the largest city in Northeastern China. Under the thin guise of research and conservation, the menagerie is a misguided attraction where visitors can purchase hapless farm animals to feed to prides of corpulent tigers (in the wild, tigers generally lead solitary existences -- only when many are crammed together will they coalesce in prides). At one time, visitors could arrange for cattle to be tossed to the tigers, but sheep (at $220 per woolly ruminant) are currently the largest sacrificial lamb. Our retrofitted bus had mesh grills instead of windows, and some passengers used tongs to feed strips of beef to the rotund felines (no one on the bus sprung for livestock). The bus travels from pen to pen, each containing dozens of the big cats.  After 40 minutes, we were deposited near a series of walkways that traverse even more pens, and here local farmers have set up shops to sell fowl and beef strips to be hand fed to the tigers.<br><br>The People's Republic of China, established in 1949 under the leadership of Mao Zedong, has a policy of state atheism. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 until 1976, the Communist nation undertook to purge remnants of capitalism and traditional elements from Chinese society, including houses of worship since religion was viewed as antithetical to Maoist thinking. Despite the nationwide destruction of churches, synagogues and mosques, historic versions of all three survive in Harbin.  It is estimated that at its peak in the 1930s, the Jewish population of Harbin reached 25,000. In 2014, when Harbin reopened its 105-year old ""Old Synagogue,"" a professor at Heilongjiang University was the only Jew residing in Harbin. So, of all the world's cities with a Jewish population, Harbin had the smallest. I visited Harbin's historical places of worship, including the Old Synagogue, which has been converted into a concert hall; the golden-domed New Synagogue, which was built in 1918, nearly a decade after the Old Synagogue was constructed in 1909; the Turkey Mosque, originally built in 1906 but reconstructed in the 1920s; and Saint Sophia Cathedral, a former Russian Orthodox church, which was closed during the Cultural Revolution and turned into a museum in 1997.",630
81,111,"June 2017 -- In June 2017, I traveled to Kosrae, one of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia. (It took me three trips to visit all four states, including visits to Yap in December 2008 and Pohnpei and Chuuk in December 2015.)  I spent five days on Kosrae, where I stayed at the Kosrae Nautilus Resort (http://kosraenautilus.com).  From what I was told, I was the only tourist on Kosrae during my visit (other overseas visitors included missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers). I made a couple of visits to the Lelu archaeological site on Lelu Island, a satellite of the larger island of Kosrae, to which a causeway connects it. The site is a massive walled city built from the 13th century that contains royal tombs and dwellings hidden behind thick tropical vegetation. From the causeway there are good views of the mountain range that has led to Kosrae being called the island of the sleeping lady.  The snorkeling was excellent, especially around the blue hole, a natural hole in the reef flat that's a 200 meter walk across the flat from the Kosrae Nautilus Resort, and Hiroshi Point, where many of the large coral heads are more than 2,000 years old.",28
82,111,"June 2017 -- I spent a few days in Tuvalu, where I stayed at Filamona Hotel (http://filamona.com), which is located right on Funafuti International Airport's runway, which at every other airport would be a disadvantage, but in Tuvalu means that the guest house is well located on Main Street.  Flights to FUN airport are so infrequent (only two or three weekly round trips from Suva, Fiji, depending on the month) that, due to limited open space, the runway is used as a common area for recreational activities. The Filamona Hotel rented me a motorbike, so I was able to cover the entire 12-kilometer length of Fongafale, the largest of Funafuti's islets. At some points the island is only 10 meters wide, so you can see the South Pacific Ocean on the east and the lagoon on the west. I also attended the 2017 Tuvalu Games, an annual multi-sport event held in Funafuti.",76
83,111,"June 2017 -- I spent a few days in Wallis and Futuna, where I stayed at Hôtel-Restaurant Lomipeau in Mata-Utu, the capital (http://www.lomipeau.wf).  The hotel is much better than some of its online reviews -- it has a very central location (a short walk from the cathedral and across the street from Maloccino, probably the island's best restaurant); clean room with an excellent ocean view; nice pool; warm water and frigid air conditioning; Wifi much better than expected; and friendly staff, at least two of whom speak English. My favorite restaurant was Maloccino, located across the street from Hotel Lomipeau and opened just a few weeks before my visit (it's one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Pacific).  On my first morning, I walked to the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Matâ'Utu, the largest building in Mata Utu, where I was very lucky to witness a kava ceremony at the King of Uvea Patalione Kanimoa's palace near the cathedral, where dozens of cooked pigs were displayed during a ceremony held in honor of a new deputy minister. French missionaries arrived in Wallis and Futuna in 1837 and, within a few years, had converted almost the entire population to Roman Catholicism. Today, the population of Wallis and Futuna is 99% Catholic.  So, Sundays find most of the population in one of several churches. I attended the early Sunday service (around 6:45 am) at the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Matâ'Utu, the largest church on Wallis. I also visited the Catholic Church in Tepa, one of the most interesting churches in the Pacific.",80
84,111,"June 2017 -- I spent a couple of days visiting Jeju, where I stayed at Hotel RegentMarine (http://www.hotelrmblue.com/index_EN.html), which is located in Jeju City on the waterfront between Black Pork Street and Raw Fish Street (those are the actual names in translation).  On my first day, I visited Jeju City, where I had lunch on Black Pork Street at Restaurant Dombedon, probably the world's only Michelin-starred pork barbecue restaurant. For dinner, I ate on Raw Fish Street, where my abalone was likely harvested by a Haenyeo, elderly, free-diving women who can descend for up to three minutes and reach depths of nearly 65 feet.  For my second day, I arranged for a car and driver (Kimi9461 (at) hanmail.net) and visited the Manjanggul lava tube and Seongsan Ilchulbong tuff cone, components of the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes UNESCO WHS.  I also visited two museums, Jeju Haenyeo Museum (which tells the story of the Haenyeo, who plunge to the sea floor to catch crustaceans, mollusks and octopi) and Jeju Loveland (an outdoor, sexually-explicit sculpture park).  Mr. Kim also arranged for us to be quickly seated, avoiding the typical hourlong wait, for lunch of abalone porridge at Myeongjin Jeonbok Abalone Restaurant, probably the most well-known and popular on Jeju.  Across from the restaurant, I was able to watch many Haenyeo dive to catch crustaceans and other sea creatures.",909
85,111,"June 2017 -- I made a day trip by train from Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to Suzhou Railway Station and then Suzhou Rail Transit to Binhe Lu Station since it was the nearest station to the Suzhou Fengqiao Scenery Spot, part of the Grand Canal of China UNESCO World Heritage SIte.  I also visited the Lingering Garden and the Humble Administrator's Garden, two of the four gardens initially inscribed under the Classical Gardens of Suzhou UNESCO World Heritage Site.  But the best site was the plate of xiaolongxia (spicy crayfish), only available during the summer season and perhaps the most flavorful dish I've ever eaten.",634
86,111,"June 2017 -- I made a day trip by train from Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to Hangzhou East Railway Station, from where it was easy to take the Hangzhou Metro to Fengqi Road Station and walk to West Lake.  West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou was inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2011.  I had lunch at Lou Wai Lou, which has been operating on the lakeshore since 1848.",644
87,111,"September 2016 -- I based myself in Hildesheim, where I visited Michaeliskirche and St. Mariä Himmelfahrt, which are inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as St. Mary's Cathedral and St. Michael's Church at Hildesheim.  I also made a day trip to Goslar to visit the mine of Rammelsberg and the old town of Goslar, which are jointly inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites as part of the Mines of Rammelsberg, Historic Town of Goslar and Upper Harz Water Management System WHS.  On the day of my departure, I made a morning visit by train to the Fagus Factory in Alfeld, which has also been inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites.",810

90,111,"September 2016 -- I began my trip in Stralsund, a Hanseatic town that has been inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites as part of Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar.  I visited the city's historic center, where the highlights are the Alter Markt, with its 13th-century Gothic Rathaus, and Marienkirche, which was the world's tallest building between 1625 and 1647.  Just outside the historic center, I visited the Ozeaneum, an aquarium that displays primarily sea life of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (https://www.ozeaneum.de).  While traveling by train from Stralsund to Hamburg, I stopped in Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to visit Schweriner Schloss (Schwerin Palace), which is regarded as one of the most important works of romantic Historicism in Europe and is on the list of tentative UNESCO World Heritage Sites as Residence Ensemble Schwerin – Cultural Landscape of Romantic Historicism.",811
91,111,"September 2016 -- I visited the Neues Palais (a unique room is the Grotto Hall, where the walls are encrusted with shells, marble, quartz and semi-precious stones) and Sanssouci, the former summer palace of Frederick the Great, both of which are part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site.",806
92,111,"September 2016 -- I based myself in Lutherstadt Wittenberg, where I visited several of the sites associated with Martin Luther that are recognized as part of the Luther Memorials in Eisleben and Wittenberg WHS, including Lutherhaus (which was the home of Martin Luther for most of his adult life), Stadt- und Pfarrkirche St. Marien zu Wittenberg (where Martin Luther preached and which saw the first celebration of mass in German rather than Latin; it is considered the mother church of the Protestant Reformation), and Schlosskirche (where Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses in October 1517).  I also made a day trip to Dessau to visit Wörlitzer Park, one of the gardens in the Garden Kingdom of Dessau-Wörlitz WHS, and the Bauhaus sites, including the Bauhaus (the most outstanding building in the serial site) and the nearby Masters’ Houses.",816
93,111,"September 2016 -- I visited Leipzig, the largest city in the federal state of Saxony, including Thomaskirche, where Johann Sebastian Bach was the choir director from 1723 until his death in 1750, and the Leipzig Zoological Garden, where the two best exhibits are Pongoland (which displays all four great apes: gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and orangutan) and Gondwanaland (the world's largest indoor rainforest hall).",815
94,111,"September 2016 -- I visited several of the contributing buildings to the Classical Weimar UNESCO World Heritage Site, including Goethe House, the St. Peter und Paul church and the Rococo Hall at the Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, which is the most impressive building in the serial site.  I also visited the Bauhaus buildings in Weimar, which are part of the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar and Dessau WHS, but they are not as interesting as the sites in Dessau, which I visited later during my trip.  My favorite place to drink was the bar at Hotel Elephant, which opened in 1696 (but which was demolished and remodeled in 1937), and to eat was Zum Schwarzen Bären, which opened in 1540 (http://www.schwarzer-baer.de).",818
95,111,"August 2016 -- I spent a few days in Zanzibar's Stone Town, named from the ubiquitous use of coral stone as the main construction material, where I visited the principal historic sites, including the old fort; the House of Wonders, which was built in 1883 and was the first building in Zanzibar to have electricity; the Old Dispensary, which was built from 1887 to 1894 by wealthy local Indians to serve as a charity hospital for the poor but was later used as a dispensary and is now the most ornate building in Stone Town; Beit el-Sahel, or the Sultan's Palace, which was built in the late 19th century for the royal family and is currently a museum that displays the daily life of the Zanzibari royal family; Christ Church, Zanzibar, which occupies a large area where the biggest slave market of Zanzibar used to be; Hamamni Persian Baths, which were built between 1870 and 1888 for use as public baths; and the Natural History Museum, which displays an extinct Zanzibar leopard.  I also visited some of the sites very loosely connected to Farrokh Bulsara, who was born in Stone Town in 1946, but who later became world famous as Freddie Mercury.  My favorite place to eat was Lukmaan Restaurant (I can't recall eating a better meal for less than $5.00) and to drink was Dreamer's Island, a floating bar near Forodhani Gardens.",419

I spent my morning snorkeling in the Moheli Marine Park, part of the Ecosystèmes Marins de l'Archipel des Comores tentative World Heritage Site (http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5107/), some of the richest coral reefs in the Mozambique channel and where I saw green sea turtles, octopus, anemone fish and moray eel.  I went on an afternoon hike with the Laka Lodge's manager to see Livingstone's fruit bats, which are endemic to Anjouan and Moheli and, with a nearly 5 ft wingspan, are one of the largest megabats.  In the evening, I visited an isolated beach around an hour from Laka Lodge to observe newborn green sea turtles scamper to the coast and enormous adults lay eggs in the very soft sand.",463

100,111,"Praslin -- In August 2016, I spent a few days in Praslin, where I rented an apartment at Praslin Holiday Home (http://www.praslinholidayhome.com), located in the center of Grand Anse.  I used Praslin's excellent public transport system to travel around the island -- local buses run around the island and trips cost approximately $0.35.  I visited Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve, where it was easy to locate coco de mer, a palm tree that contains the largest seed in the plant kingdom.  I also spent a day at Grand'Anse Praslin, which is often ranked as one of the world's most beautiful beaches, where I had lunch at Bonbon Plume.<br><br>La Digue -- I made a day trip by Inter Island Ferry (https://www.seychellesbookings.com) from Praslin to La Digue, where I rented a bicycle to visit Anse Source d'Argent, one of the world's most beautiful beaches, and the Aldabra giant tortoise pen at L'Union Estate.<br><br>Victoria, Mahe -- I stayed at Hilltop Boutique Hotel, a historic home at the edge of Victoria (http://www.hilltop.sc), and had dinner at Marie-Antoinette Restaurant, which opened in 1972 in a 19th-century home (http://www.marieantoinette.sc/en/home/index.php).

101,111,"July 2016 -- I stayed at Beachcomber Lodge (http://beachcomberlhi.com.au) and rented a car from Wilson&apos;s Hire Service.  My main objective was to see the Lord Howe Island stick insects that are kept at the Lord Howe Island Museum (http://www.lhimuseum.com).  The stick insects were once very common on Lord Howe Island, but became extinct on the main island soon after black rats were introduced in 1918 when a supply ship ran aground. The last walking stick was observed on Lord Howe Island in 1920, after which time the species was thought to be extinct.  In 2001, Australian scientists scaled nearby Ball&apos;s Pyramid and discovered a small population of 24 walking sticks living beneath a shrub.  In 2003, scientists collected two breeding pairs, and the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens has since successfully bred walking sticks (more than 9,000 according to the most recent estimate in 2012).  Breeding pairs have since been sent to zoos at San Diego, Toronto and Bristol.  I also spent time searching for Lord Howe woodhen, which are now relatively abundant but which had declined to 30 known birds by the late 1970s.",32

103,111,"July 2016 -- I spent a few days in Mount Hagen, where I stayed at the Highlander Hotel (http://www.coralseahotels.com.pg/index.php/locations/highlander-hotel).  Mount Hagen is a short drive from the Kuk Early Agricultural Site, Papua New Guinea's only World Heritage Site, which demonstrates a technological leap that transformed plant exploitation to agriculture around 7,000 to 6,400 years ago, based on vegetative propagation of bananas, taro and yam.  Kuk, however, is probably only interesting to agricultural historians and wasn't that interesting to a more casual visitor; in fact, the core area, at least to me, was indistinguishable from the buffer zone, which looked similar to most of the agricultural areas surrounding Mount Hagen.  Papau New Guinea is best known for its avifauna, so my main objective was to see at least one species of bird-of-paradise in the wild.  I went bird watching at Kumul Lodge, which is located at high altitude about an hour from Mount Hagen (http://www.kumul-lodge.com).  During my afternoon at Kumul, I saw two birds-of-paradise, a male ribbon-tailed astrapia, one of the iconic, flamboyant birds-of-paradise, and a female brown sicklebill, which is more restrained.  I also visited two markets in Mount Hagen, the central market, which is largely devoted to agricultural products, and the betel nut market, which is not as frequently visited.  Deep in the betel nut market you can find the vendors selling marijuana, which they refer to as PNG gold; contrary to my expectations, the marijuana vendors were not reserved and actively sought to be photographed.  My favorite place to drink was the members' bar at the Hagen Club, but visitors may need an invitation in order to enter.<br><br>I arranged my flights so that I would not have to overnight in Port Moresby, the very uninteresting capital of one of the most interesting countries, but I did coordinate to allow for a several hour stopover.  During my time in Port Moresby, I visited Adventure Park PNG, which is more of an aviary and zoo than amusement park.  The aviary displays 11 of the 42 species of bird-of-paradise, including Raggiana bird-of-paradise, the national bird of Papua New Guinea, and the zoo displays several species of tree kangaroo, the country's iconic mammal.  I ended my stay in Port Moresby drinking at the Royal Papua Yacht Club, but visitors may need a member's invitation in order to gain entry (http://www.rpyc.com.pg).  I made all of my arrangements with Aaron Hayes at Ecotourism Melanesia (http://www.em.com.pg).",54
104,111,"July 2016 -- I stayed in Honiara at the King Solomon Hotel, which is constructed on a hillside so rooms are reached via funicular (http://www.kingsolomonhotel.info).  The highlights in the Honiara area were the Guadalcanal American Memorial, a World War II monument established as a tribute to the Americans and their allies who lost their lives during the Guadalcanal Campaign from August 1942 to February 1943; the Vilu War Museum, which displays World War II relics like planes and cannons; the National Museum, which has a display on John F. Kennedy and Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109; and Honiara Central Market.  During my visit, the Free Papua Movement was engaged in demonstrations and I met Benny Wenda at my hotel, where he held meeting with regional leaders, including Manasseh Sogavare, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands.",67
105,111,"July 2016 -- I visited during off-season, when only three rooms were occupied at the Paradise Hotel & Resort, where I stayed (http://paradisehotelnorfolk.com).  I rented a car from Aloha Rent-a-Car (http://www.aloha.nlk.nf), which I used to explore the island over three days.  I visited  the main sites, including the Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area, which is part of the Australian Convict Sites WHS, Emily Bay lagoon, the Captain Cook Monument overlooking the location where Captain James Cook is believed to have made land, the Mount Pitt lookout and Norfolk Island National Park.  My favorite places to eat were at the sporting facilities, where I had lunch at Norfolk Island Golf Club (http://www.norfolkislandgolf.com) and dinner at Norfolk Island Lawn Bowls (http://www.norfolkislandlawnbowls.com).  Norfolk Island is the most attractive island that I have visited.",46
106,111,"July 2016 -- I stayed at Taloa Heights, which is well located in the center of Alofi (http://taloaheightsniue.nu), a short walk from the island&apos;s two best restaurants, Kaiika, which serves fresh sushi (unlike sushi in New York, all of which must be frozen before serving) (http://kaiika.com), and Gills Indian Restaurant.  My favorite activity was snorkeling at Snake Gully near Avatele Beach, where it was easy to approach highly venomous katuali (or flat-tail sea snakes).  I arranged my snorkeling trip with Buccaneer Adventures Niue Dive (http://www.dive.nu).  I also hiked several of the island&apos;s sea tracks, including those to Togo chasm, Anapala fresh water pool, Matapa chasm and Talava arches.",45
107,111,"July 2016 -- I flew from Cairns to Horn Island and then took a ferry (http://www.tiferry.com.au) to Thursday Island, the administrative and commercial centre of the Torres Strait Island Region.  I had lunch at the Torres Strait Hotel, which claims to be Australia&apos;s northernmost pub, and drank at the Federal Hotel, which was built in the early 1900s.",73
108,111,"June 2016 -- I based myself at the very basic Menen Hotel (http://menenhotelnauru.com).  I had originally arranged to rent a car from Capelle & Partner, but during lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants that is within walking distance of the Menen Hotel, the proprietor offered to show me around the island (I think he was bored and looking for something to do).  We drove around the island, where the most interesting sites were the limestone pinnacles that line the coast and the industrial remains of the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.  We also drove around the bleak interior to attempt to visit the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, which I was able to discretely photograph.  Nauru is a very strange place, where the local population (the most obese and diabetic in the world) mixes with resettled refugees, mostly groups of Middle Eastern men.  Having visited, it's easy to understand why Nauru is the least visited country in the world.",39
109,111,"Hokkaido  Prefecture -- In January 2016 I visited Sapporo, the largest city on Hokkaido, including the former Hokkaid&#333; Government Office, Sapporo Clock Tower (often ranked as the third least interesting tourist attraction in Japan; in my view, the third position is too generous since it was the least interesting attraction that I visited) and Nijo Market.  I ate at Donburichaya, located within Nijo Market, where I had donburi (a bowl of rice topped with a variety of seafood), and one of the several restaurants that line Sapporo Ramen Yokocho (or Ramen Alley).",567
110,111,"Iwate Prefecture -- In January 2016 I traveled by train from Sendai to Hiraizumi, where I rented a bicycle just outside the train station to visit M&#333;ts&#363;-ji (which contains a Pure Land garden) and Ch&#363;son-ji to see Konjiki-d&#333; (or the Golden Hall), all of which are part of the Hiraizumi – Temples, Gardens and Archaeological Sites Representing the Buddhist Pure Land UNESCO World Heritage Site (not a very interesting World Heritage Site).<br><br>Miyagi Prefecture -- In January 2016 I visited Sendai, where I had gyutan, or grilled beef tongue, for lunch at one of the several gyutan restaurants on Gyutan Dori (Gyutan Street), located on the third floor of Sendai Station.  I had walked over to Aji Tasuke, which claims to have created gyutan, but it was closed for the New Year holiday.",798
111,111,"Ehime Prefecture -- In December 2015 I took the Super Jet ferry (http://setonaikaikisen.co.jp) from Hiroshima to Matsuyama, the largest city in Shikoku (upon presentment of a passport, discounts are given to overseas visitors).  The ferry arrives at Matsuyama Kanko Port, from where it's a short ride on the Iyo Railway suburban train to Matsuyama Station.  I had lunch at Goshiki, which is well known for Goshiki Somen, or thin noodles in five different colors (but each color tasted the same to me).  The highlight in Matsuyama is D&#333;go Onsen, one of Japan's oldest and most famous hot springs, where I bathed in the public bathhouse in the Dogo Onsen Honkan, a Meiji period wooden public bathhouse, dating from 1894.  I also visited Matsuyama Castle (Iyo).",797
112,111,"Fukuoka Prefecture -- In December 2015 I visited Fukuoka, where I stayed at Ryokan Kashima Honkan, which was constructed during the Taisho period (1912 to 1925) and is located in the Gion area.  The Gion area has some of Fukuoka's few remaining historic buildings, including Sh&#333;fuku-ji (completed in 1195, making it the oldest Zen temple in Japan) and Kushida-jinja, a Shinto shrine.  I had dinner at one of the yatai (or outdoor food stalls) on the southern end of Nakasu island.<br><br>Nagasaki Prefecture -- In June 2017 I visited Nagasaki, where I stayed at Hotel Monterey Nagasaki (http://www.hotelmonterey.co.jp/en/htl/nagasaki/), which is located a very short walk from the departure point for the Gunkanjima Concierge Company (https://www.gunkanjima-concierge.com/en/).  I joined one of the tours to visit Hashima Island, commonly called Gunkanjima (or Battleship Island), an abandoned island lying 15 kilometers from Nagasaki. Its nickname comes from the resemblance of its profile to a Japanese battleship. The island was known for its seabed coal deposits, which were mined, sometimes by forced labor during World War II, from 1887 until 1974, when the mine was closed, leaving the island abandoned. The island was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites in 2015 as one of the Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution, and has only been open to tourists since 2009. Battleship Island served as the villain's lair in the James Bond film <i>Skyfall</i>.  &#332;ura Church, built in 1864 soon after the end of Japan's period of seclusion, is a short walk from Hotel Monterey Nagasaki.  &#332;ura Church is the oldest church in Japan, and, along with a dozen other sites in and around Nagasaki relating to the history of Christianity in Japan, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  I also visited Nagasaki Peace Park and the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum commemorating the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, the second city upon which an atomic bomb was dropped, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima. On my last day in Nagasaki, I visited the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium, the only aquarium in the world that focuses on penguins (https://penguin-aqua.jp/english/). Of the 18 typically recognized species of penguin, the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium exhibits nine, more than any other aquarium.",796
113,111,"Hiroshima Prefecture -- In December 2015 I visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (commonly called the Atomic Bomb Dome), which was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1996.  The Atomic Bomb Dome serves as a memorial to those who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945.  For dinner, I had Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki at Okonomimura, a three-floor food theme park where each of the 25 restaurants serves a slightly different style of okonomiyaki (http://www.okonomimura.jp).  Since I had a Japan Rail Pass, I took the JR Sanyo Line from Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi Station, a short walk to the pier where ferries depart frequently for Miyajima and the Itsukushima Shinto Shrine, which has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  The famous torii (or Japanese gate) at Itsukushima Shrine is one of the three most celebrated scenic sights in Japan.",793
114,111,"Okinawa Prefecture -- In December 2015 I visited Naha, the capital city of Okinawa, where it was very easy to get around the city on the Okinawa Urban Monorail.  From the airport, I took the monorail to visit Shuri Castle, a reconstructed Ry&#363;ky&#363;an gusuku (or stone-walled fortress) that has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  I ate at Makishi Market, where visitors can purchase seafood from the ground floor market stalls, which could be cooked and served at an upstairs restaurant.  I purchased an unusual giant sea snail, which proved tough and tasteless.",63
115,111,"December 2015 -- I spent a couple of days in Chuuk, where I stayed at the Truk Stop Hotel (http://thetrukstophotel.com).  During World War II, Japan maintained a substantial part of its naval fleet within the Truk (now Chuuk) Lagoon.  In mid-February 1944, the United States Navy conducted a massive attack against the Japanese navy, sinking 12 warships, 32 merchant ships and 249 aircraft, many of which can now be visited by diving or snorkeling inside the lagoon.  I joined a dive boat organized by the Truk Lagoon Dive Center, located at the Truk Stop Hotel (http://trukwreckdiving.com/index.php), and snorkeled at the Sankisan Maru, a 370 foot cargo ship, where the coral encrusted mast rises to within a few feet of the surface, and a Mitsubishi A6M Zero that rests in shallow water.  Chuuk is not an island to be visited for its terrestrial sites.",9
116,111,"December 2015 -- I spent a couple of days in Pohnpei at the Mangrove Bay Hotel (http://www.mangrovebaypohnpei.com), a short walk from downtown Kolonia, the capital of Pohnpei.  Kolonia is not a very interesting place, but I did manage to find a couple of historic sites like the Spanish wall, built in 1899 as a boundary for Fort Alphonso XII.  The wall is one of the few remaining remnants of Spanish control and now serves as the outfield wall for the baseball field.  I also wandered around and found the Catholic bell tower and adjoining masonry apse, all that remain of a church built in 1909 by German Capuchin missionaries, when Pohnpei and the other Caroline Islands were administered as part of German New Guinea.<br><br>I organized a trip to Nan Madol with Pohnpei Surf Club, which is located on the ground floor of the Mangrove Bay Hotel (http://www.pohnpeisurfclub.com).  I paid $125, which accounts for solo travel on Christmas (it would be less expensive with a  group).  There is a tide chart stapled to the Pohnpei Surf Club&apos;s door, so you could time your visit to Nan Madol for low tide, as I did, when I was able to wade across the channel that separates the complex from the main island (at high tide, a visitor would need to swim or arrange for a kayak, which I heard is difficult to arrange).  From the Mangrove Bay Hotel, it was a 45-minute drive to the beginning of the footpath to Nan Madol, where I paid the $3 entrance fee.  The path, through the mangroves, was well maintained (many sections seem to be relatively new boardwalks), and I saw a lot of mudskippers and mangrove crabs and heard a lot of birds.  After a 15-minute walk, we arrived at the narrow channel that separates Nan Madol from the mainland -- since it was low tide, with the water less than one foot deep, my guide and I were able to wade across to Nan Madol.  I spent an hour or so wandering around Nan Madol, where there were no other visitors, and after clambering over fallen pieces of the original structures, ended my visit at a point where Nan Madol meets a few larger channels.  Upon departure, my driver stopped by the local chief&apos;s home and paid another $3 fee.  On the way back from Nan Madol, we stopped at Kepirohi Waterfall, where I was able to swim in the pool beneath the falls and cool off.  From what I&apos;ve read, this is a standard stop on the way back from Nan Madol.  Nan Madol is one of the two best archaeological sites in the Pacific (along with Easter Island), but it is also one of the most glaring omissions from the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Nan Madol will not, I was told, be eligible for inscription until the government and locals resolve conflicting ownership claims.",58
117,111,"December 2015 -- I spent a couple of days in Majuro, where I stayed in a bungalow suite at Hotel Robert Reimers (http://www.hotelrobertreimers.com), located in the center of Delap-Uliga-Djarrit, the capital and largest city of the Marshall Islands.  There is very little to see in D-U-D, so it&apos;s much more interesting to visit one of the nearby pristine islands or atolls, like Eneko Island (30 minutes from D-U-D by boat organized by Hotel Robert Reimers).  The best places to eat and drink in Majuro are the Tide Table Restaurant and Lounge and The Grill at the Shoreline, both of which are located at the hotel.",35
118,111,"November 2015 -- On Wednesday, November 25, 2015, I spent a 122-hour day on Kiritimati (Christmas Island).  On that day, I intended to take FJ822, which is scheduled to depart Nadi International Airport shortly after midnight and to stop at Cassidy International Airport, the airport located on Kiritimati, at 6:30am, on its way to Honolulu International Airport, and to take FJ823, which is scheduled to stop on Kiritimati at 4:15pm during its return run from Honolulu to Nadi.  Flight FJ822 departed on time, but at some point between our departure and scheduled arrival, one of the heaviest storms in recent memory settled over Kiritimati.  The plane made its first attempt at landing shortly after the scheduled arrival time, but since the runway was not visible, the pilots aborted the first attempted landing.  During the next 2&#189; hours, the plane attempted two more landings, both of which were abandoned at the last minute.  Finally, and, as I was later to learn, running perilously low on fuel, the fourth landing attempt was successful and several of us disembarked into a deluge.  Needless to say, sightseeing on Kiritimati during the downpour was impossible.  Later that afternoon, we returned to Cassidy International Airport, where we learned, not surprisingly, that the return flight would not land, as had been scheduled, in Kiritimati; instead, Fiji Airways would redirect the following Monday&apos;s flight from Honolulu to stop in Kiritimati on its journey to Nadi.  Unexpectedly, I gained four additional days on Kiritimati.  While I was initially disappointed because I was woefully underprepared for an extended stay, I visited both local stores, bought some clothing, toiletries and supplies and checked into the Captain Cook Hotel, which was built in 1975 on a former British military base (http://www.captaincookhotel-kiribati.com).  During Wednesday night, the storm passed and I awoke to a perfect day -- in fact, the weather for the balance of the trip would likewise be perfect -- which I spent on pristine beaches, purchasing lobsters caught in the lagoon, and otherwise sightseeing.  The local residents were extremely generous.  For example, I was invited for a dinner of fish curry and rum at the home of the manager of a local general store.  In addition, a local airline employee made his car available to a group of us, which we used to explore Kiritimati, which has the greatest land area of any coral atoll in the world.  On Monday, November 30, 2015, Fiji Airways landed on schedule and I departed just before 11:00am.  By the end of my five-day visit, I was glad that my trip had an unplanned extension.",30
119,111,"June 2017 -- I spent a few days in Fiji since it's the gateway to Wallis and Futuna and Tuvalu.  I spent time wandering around Nadi, which has a large Indo-Fijian population, so is the center for Hinduism in Fiji. Nadi's Sri Siva Subramaniya temple is the largest Hindu temple in the Southern Hemisphere. I also visited Nadi's municipal produce market, which has a large number of stalls selling kava roots, which are used to make an elixir with sedative and euphoric properties.  I took a public bus from Nadi to Sigatoka to visit Kula Eco Park's zoo, which focuses on Fiji's indigenous reptiles and birds, and the sand dunes in Sigatoka Sand Dunes National Park, which were formed over millions of years by river sediment that has been wind blown into dunes.<br><br>November/December 2015 -- I began my trip in Suva, where I stayed at the Grand Pacific Hotel, which was built by the Union Steamship Company in 1914, closed in 1992 and expertly restored and reopened in May 2014 (http://grandpacifichotel.com.fj).  The most interesting sites in Suva were the cannibal artifacts at the Fiji Museum and the kava stalls on the top floor of the Suva Municipal Market.  I flew (http://www.northernair.com.fj) from Suva to Levuka, the first colonial capital of Fiji, ceded to the British in 1874, and Fiji's only inscription on the list of World Heritage Sites (http://www.levukafiji.com).  In Levuka, I stayed at the Royal Hotel, the oldest hotel in the South Pacific, dating back to the 1860s, although it was rebuilt after a fire in the early 1900s (http://www.royallevuka.com/royallevuka/Welcome.html).  I also visited the Yasawa and Mamanuca Islands, volcanic archipelagos lying to the northwest of Viti Levu, the largest island in Fiji.  First, I traveled on the Yasawa Flyer catamaran (http://www.awesomefiji.com/transfers/) and spent a few days at the Octopus Resort, located on Waya Island, the largest landmass in the Yasawa Islands (http://www.octopusresort.com).  I also made a day trip to Cloud 9, a two-level floating platform that contains a bar and pizzeria and which is located off Malolo Island in the Mamanuca Islands (http://www.cloud9.com.fj).  Due to its proximity to Port Denarau (the departure point to the Yasawa Islands and Cloud 9), I based myself at the Hilton Fiji Beach Resort and Spa on Denarau Island at the end of my trip; while the hotel was very nice, Denarau Island ranks among the least appealing places that I have visited and is certainly the least interesting destination in Fiji and the South Pacific.",17
120,111,"September 2015 -- I spent three days in Bari, where I visited Barivecchia (old Bari), including Basilica di San Nicola, which is included on the list of tentative World Heritage Sites as one of the Romanesque Cathedrals in Puglia.  My favorite dish in Bari, which I had twice, was orecchiette alle cime di rapa (orecchiette was created in Apulia).  I made a day trip by train (https://www.fseonline.it) to Alberobello to see its trulli, traditional Apulian dry stone huts with conical roofs, which are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  I also visited Lecce, which is known as the &#34;Florence of the South&#34; and included on the list of tentative World Heritage Sites as Salento and the Barocco Leccese, and Brindisi to visit the Roman column marking the end of the ancient Via Appia, which is included on the list of tentative World Heritage Sites as Via Appia &#34;Regina Viarum.&#34;",893

There is evidence that people were living in the Sassi as early as 7000 BCE and they are suspected to be among the first human settlements in Italy.",894
122,111,"September 2015 -- I spent three nights in Cagliari at Hotel Miramare, which is centrally located on Via Roma (http://www.hotelmiramarecagliari.it).  The most interesting museums in Cagliari are Le Cere Anatomiche (the Wax Anatomy Museum), which displays many of the most important, highly realistic anatomical models created by Clemente Susini (on a separate trip I had seen many of his anatomical models on display at La Specola, or the Museum of Zoology and Natural History, in Florence), and the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, which exhibits many of the Giants of Mont&apos;e Prama.  My favorite restaurants in Cagliari are Trattoria Lillicu (founded in 1938), Trattoria Sa Turra (1933) and Ristorante Corallo (1881).  I also made a day trip to Su Nuraxi di Barumini, a nuragic archaeological site and Sardinia&apos;s only entry on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (http://www.sardiniamagicexperience.com).",309
123,111,"September 2015 -- I rented a scooter to circumnavigate Lampedusa, where my first stop was <i>Spiaggia dei Conigli</i> (or Rabbit Beach), which is generally considered one of the world&apos;s most beautiful beaches (which might have been the case if it had not been so crowded), and the nearby <i>Isola dei Conigli</i> (or Rabbit Island).  I continued my loop by driving along the more interesting barren northern coast, which is dominated by vertical sheer cliffs.  My favorite snack was <i>fritto in coppo</i> (a paper cone filled with fried squid) from Trattoria Pescheria Azzura on Via Roma.",286
124,111,"May 2015 -- I took a marshrutka from Batumi to Kutaisi, where I spent one night and hired a taxi (&#4314;50) to visit Gelati Monastery and Bagrati Cathedral, which have been jointly inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  From Kutaisi, I took another marshrutka to Tbilisi, where I stayed at the Tbilisi Marriott Hotel,  which opened as the Majestic in 1915 (http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tbsmc-tbilisi-marriott-hotel/).  The most interesting part of Tbilisi, itself the most attractive city in the Caucasus, is its old town, where I visited the sulphur baths in Abanotubani (I was able to rent sandals and a towel) and took a cable car to visit Kartvlis Deda, a 20-meter aluminum statue of a woman in Georgian national dress.  I made a day trip from Tbilisi by marshrutka to Mtskheta to visit the Historical Monuments of Mtskheta, a World Heritage Site.  Georgian food and wine are excellent and my favorite dishes were khinkali (dumplings), kachapuri (circular bread filled with cheese) and churchkhela (walnuts threaded onto a string and dipped in thickened grape juice).  My favorite places to drink were g.Vino, which has an encyclopedic collection of Georgian wine, and Schuchmann Wine Bar (http://www.schuchmann-wines.com/en/index.html).",491
125,111,"May 2015 -- I visited Batumi, the capital of Adjara, an autonomous republic in southwest Georgia.

127,111,"December 2014 -- I began my trip in Luang Prabang, one of the most charming small cities in Southeast Asia and whose old town center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where I stayed at the Belle Rive Hotel, constructed from three adjacent colonial houses along the Mekong riverfront (http://www.thebellerive.com).  Among other places, I visited the Royal Palace Museum (within the Royal Palace built in 1904), Phu Si (which offers panoramic views of Luang Prabang) and Wat Xiang Thong.  The most interesting place to eat was the Riverside Barbecue Restaurant, which offers tabletop barbecue.  From Luang Prabang, I flew (via an overnight in Vientiane) to Xieng Khouang Airport, the air gateway to the Plain of Jars, where I stayed at the Vansana Plain of Jars Hotel in Phonsavan (http://www.vansana-plain-of-jars-hotel.com).  I pre-arranged a tour of the Plain of Jars with Tey Lassada, who is responsive, well informed and fluent in English (he can be contacted at lasdadatey@gmail.com).  In order to avoid crowds, which were minimal in any event, we visited the sites in reverse order, beginning at Site 3 (which has about 150 jars on a wooded hillside), then Site 2 (spread around a pair of hillocks) and finally Site 1 (the largest collection with 334 jars or jar fragments).  I also passed through Vientiane a couple of times, where I stayed at the Salana Boutique Hotel (http://www.salanaboutique.com).  Vientiane is probably the quietest Southeast Asian capital city, but it&apos;s also the least interesting, with only one major historic site, Wat Si Sakset (built between 1819 and 1824 and Vientiane&apos;s oldest surviving temple).",515
128,111,"December 2014 -- I flew on Air KBZ (http://airkbz.com), which I was able to book online, to Nyaung U Airport, the primary air gateway to Bagan.  I stayed in Old Bagan in the Prince of Wales Suite, constructed in 1922 for the visit by the future King Edward VIII, at the Bagan Thande Hotel (http://www.baganthandehotel.net).  I visited the Bagan Archaeological Zone from the ground, where the highlights were Gubyaukgyi (known for its frescoes), Shwesandaw Paya (which affords some of the best overall views of the archaeological zone), Ananda Pahto (one of the finest, largest and best preserved temples with four large standing buddha statues), Thatbyinnyu Pahto (Bagan&apos;s highest temple) and Dhammayangyi Pahto (Bagan&apos;s largest temple), and from above by hot air balloon with Balloons over Bagan, which permitted panoramic views of the entire Bagan Archaeological Zone (http://www.easternsafaris.com/balloonsoverbagan_home.html).  I also visited the colonial area of Yangon, which has one of the largest collections of colonial buildings in Southeast Asia, although many are dilapidated, including the Supreme Court of Burma, Customs House, Strand Hotel (where I drank in the bar) and Central Post Office.  My favorite place to eat in Yangon was the food stalls that line 19th Street (between Mahabandoola Road and Anwratha Street) in China Town.  I concluded with a visit to Shwedagon Pagoda, the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar.",525

I flew to Constantine, which is built around a gorge and known as the City of Bridges, and made a day trip to Timgad, a consummate example of a Roman military colony created ex nihilo, and its nearby Mauseleum of Medracen.  On the drive back to Algiers I visited Djémila, an interesting example of Roman town planning adapted to a mountain location.

The highlight was the late night tour to Aurora Village (http://www.auroravillage.com/index.html) to see aurora borealis (the northern lights), but it was cloudy so the lights, while visible, were faint and difficult to photograph.  The temperature was -6°F, but the clothing that I rented from Aurora Village was more than adequate to keep me warm while standing on a frozen lake searching for aurora borealis.

Pointe-à-Pitre is not one of the Caribbean's most attractive cities, but it does have several interesting colonial buildings, including Musée Saint-John Perse (an uninteresting museum that devoted more exhibition space to textiles than to Nobel laureate Alexis Léger, but is housed within an attractive 19th-century colonial building with ornate wrought-iron balconies), La Cathédrale Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul (with arches  constructed of riveted iron girders, reflecting the influence of past hurricanes and earthquakes) and a few surrounding Place de la Victoire.

212,111,"<p>September 2018 -- I visited several museums during my most recent visit, including the&nbsp;Kunstkamera, founded in 1727 and considered the first museum in Russia, which has evolved into the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography. The museum holds more than two million items highlighting cultures from around the world, but most visitors&nbsp;are drawn to its cabinet of curiosities full of human deformities, mainly a collection of anatomically&nbsp;deficient fetuses like two-headed boys and cyclopes. &nbsp;I revisited the&nbsp;Hermitage Museum, the world&rsquo;s second-largest art museum (after the Louvre), but with the largest collection of paintings, which is displayed in over 360 galleries covering miles of corridors on three floors in five buildings. The Hermitage exhibits an astonishing collection of artworks from nearly every major artist important to the Western canon through the early twentieth century, including entire rooms devoted to Rembrandt and Matisse. &nbsp;Between 1885 and 1927, Carl Faberg&eacute; made 65 jeweled eggs, mainly for the Russian Tsars to give as Easter presents to their wives and mothers, 57 of which survive. Until 2004, the world&rsquo;s second-largest collection of Faberg&eacute; eggs could be seen at the Forbes Galleries in New York, when Malcolm Forbes&rsquo; heirs decided to auction their nine eggs. Two months before the auction, a Russian oligarch privately purchased the jeweled eggs (supposedly for $100 million), now on display at the Faberg&eacute; Museum as part of the world&#39;s largest collection of works by the House of Faberg&eacute;. &nbsp;The Zoological Museum is known for its collection of four woolly mammoths &mdash; three juveniles and a massive adult &mdash; whose frozen carcasses were excavated in Siberia, where the last known population remained on an island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, contemporaneous with the construction of the Great Pyramid in ancient Egypt. &nbsp;My favorite places to eat during this trip were Palkin (established in 1785, but only open in its current location since 1874),&nbsp;Pyshechnaya (which has only been serving powdered sugar-dusted donuts since 1958), and&nbsp;Restoran.</p>

<p>May 2006 -- I spent four days in Saint Petersburg during the White Nights Festival. During that time, I saw Valery Gergiev conduct Tchaikovsky&#39;s <em>Swan Lake&nbsp;</em>at the Mariinsky Theatre. &nbsp;Saint Petersburg has many great museums, including the State Hermitage Museum (in May 2006, I also visited the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art, which I rank along with the Hermitage as the three best comprehensive art museums in the world) and the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, one of the largest and best natural history museums in the world, with a great collection of mummified mammoths. My favorite restaurant in the city, Restoran (2 Tamozhenny Pereulok), is located just behind the Zoological Museum.&nbsp;I also spent an afternoon tracing the sites associated with Dostoevsky, including the locations from <em>Crime and Punishment</em> like the apartment where Raskolnikov murdered Alyona Ivanovna (it is not easy to find, but is well marked with golden balls leading up the stairwell to the door of the apartment), and an afternoon at Alexander Nevsky Monastery and Cemetery, where many of Russia&#39;s leading cultural figures are buried in elaborate graves, including Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Mussorgsky. &nbsp;An easy day trip from the city is Peterhof Palace, which is connected to the city center by frequent hydrofoils from just outside the Hermitage.</p>

New York also plays host to many of the country&apos;s best annual sporting events, and I have attended the US Open (tennis) every year since 1996, and the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of horse racing&apos;s Triple Crown, in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2014 (the eight most recent unsuccessful attempts to capture the Triple Crown), and 2015, when American Pharoah won and broke the 37-year drought between Triple Crown champions.<br><br>Buffalo -- In November 2009 I visited Buffalo, where I ate at the city&apos;s two most famous places for buffalo wings, the Anchor Bar, which claims to have created buffalo wings (http://www.anchorbar.com/), and Duff&apos;s Famous Wings (established in 1969).",121
220,111,"May 2011 -- I took a bus from Asuncion, Paraguay to Formosa, the capital of the province of the same name.  The bus ride through the Gran Chaco, a sparsely populated, hot and semi-arid lowland region teeming with birdlife, was stunning and a lot more interesting than the provincial capital.",758
221,111,"May 2011 -- I visited Asuncion, where I stayed at Asuncion Palace Hotel, which is housed in a historic building from 1858 (http://www.asuncionhotelpalace.com/), and had dinner at Bar San Roque, the country's oldest restaurant, where I had grilled surubí, a river catfish.  ",173
222,111,"December 2001 and August 2017 -- In August 2017, I made a couple of stops in Xi'an, the starting point for the Silk Road's network of trade routes that connected the East and West. While silk was China's major export, trade along the Silk Road led to the migration of many religions, philosophies and technologies. All that from a textile produced from caterpillar cocoons.  During my first full day, I visited the illuminated Bell Tower; the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, which stands 210 ft tall, has existed in its current form since 704 and is now part of the Silk Roads UNESCO World Heritage Site; and the Great Mosque in Xi'an's Muslim quarter, the most atmospheric area of the city.  On my second full day, I visited what I consider history's greatest archaeological discovery, which was neither made by a university research team on a decadeslong quest for buried treasures nor a well-funded geographical expedition. In March 1974, Chinese peasant farmers digging a well in Xi'an discovered the largest pottery figurine group ever found in China. The authorities were notified, archaeologists were dispatched, and thousands of unique clay soldiers, positioned according to military rank, along with horses and chariots, were uncovered.  The Terracotta Army is a collection of third-century BCE terracotta sculptures buried with China's first emperor to protect him in his afterlife. The sculptures are arranged in trenchlike underground corridors and displayed in three pits, of which Pit 1, the size of an airplane hangar, is the largest.  I also visited Xi'an in December 2001, primarily to see the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (better known as the Terracotta Army).  Two memorable meals during my first visit were dumplings at De Fa Chang and Yang Rou Pao Mo (a soup dish that involves breaking wheat-flour flat bread into a bowl and adding mutton stock) in Xi'an's muslim quarter.",639
223,111,"August 2001 -- I visited Lake Malawi and stayed at the Livingstonia Beach Hotel in Senga Bay, a two-hour drive from Lilongwe (http://www.sunbirdmalawi.com/livingstonia/livingstonia_beach.htm).

I also visited the Stuart Grant Tropical Fish Farm, which raises cichlids for export (http://www.lakemalawi.com/).",389
224,111,"May 2000 and August 2002 -- On my first trip I stayed at the Mount Nelson Hotel, the most historic in Cape Town and one of the most historic hotels in Africa (http://www.mountnelson.co.za/), but on my second trip I stayed at the better located Victoria & Alfred Hotel, which is located on the waterfront (http://www.newmarkhotels.com/newmark/vahotel/).

I visited all four sites: (1) Maeshowe -- a unique chambered cairn and passage grave, which was looted by Vikings who left one of the largest collection of runic inscriptions in the world; (2) Standing Stones of Stenness -- the four remaining megaliths of a henge, the largest of which is six meters high; (3) Ring of Brodgar -- a stone circle 104 meters in diameter; and (4) Skara Brae -- a cluster of ten houses making up Northern Europe’s best-preserved Neolithic village.",303
226,111,"December 2011 -- I began my trip in Mysore, where I visited Mysore Palace (the most crowded interior of any tourist attraction that I have ever visited).  I then traveled to Kabini River Lodge (http://www.kabiniriverlodge.com/) and went on safari in Nagarhole National Park, part of the Western Ghats tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site, where I saw large groups of Asian elephants, gaur (the largest species of wild cattle) and chital.

I then traveled by bus to León, which is known for its churches, and I visited the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, Iglesia de la Recoleccion and Iglesia de la Merced.<br><br>March 2008 -- I spent one day in Managua, where I stayed at Hotel Los Robles (http://www.hotellosrobles.com/), which is within walking distance of the UCA minibus station.

296,111,"August 2017 -- In 1979, Shenzhen, then with a population of 30,000 and no building taller than five stories, was a small Chinese village on Hong Kong's doorstep. Since that time, when Shenzhen was designated China’s first Special Economic Zone, its population has exploded to 10.4 million and more than a hundred skyscrapers have been erected, a greater population than every U.S. city and more skyscrapers than every U.S. city except New York and Chicago. But those lofty figures didn't prevent Shenzhen from being the least interesting city that I have visited (and I have foolishly visited twice, first in 1995).",543
297,111,"August 2016 -- I flew from Zanzibar to Mombasa, where I stayed at the Castle Royal Hotel, which dates from 1909 (http://www.sentrimhotels.net/index.php/sentrim-castle-royal-hotels-in-mombasa) and is centrally located between the Moi Avenue tusks and Mombasa Old Town.  I walked from my hotel to the Spice Market and then through the Old Town to Fort Jesus, a Portuguese fort built between 1593 and 1596 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  I made a day trip from Mombasa to Kaya Kinondo, one of the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests UNESCO World Heritage Site (the kindest thing that I could write is that its universal value escaped me) (http://www.kaya-kinondo-kenya.com).  On my return from the Kaya, I went on safari in Shimba Hills National Reserve.  I flew to Lamu, where I stayed at Subira House, which was built 200 years ago by the governor of the Sultan of Zanzibar (http://www.subirahouse.com).  Due to Lamu's proximity to Somalia and some recent incidents, there were very few tourists in Lamu and I was the only guest at Subira House.  The highlights in Lamu were visiting the Donkey Sanctuary, which works to improve the health and condition of Lamu's principal means of transport (https://www.thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk/project/lamu), and eating and drinking at Peponi Hotel in nearby Shela village (http://www.peponi-lamu.com).  I made a day trip from Nairobi to go on safari in Lake Nakuru NP, where it was easy to see lion, huge groups of buffalo, Rothschild giraffe and white rhino.  I also spent a couple of days wandering around Nairobi, which was much safer than I recalled, and I visited the August 7th Memorial Park, which commemorates the site of the former American Embassy destroyed in 1999 (http://www.memorialparkkenya.org), and the Nairobi Railway Museum, which exhibits trains from defunct East African railroads, including a coach attacked by the lions of Tsavo, and went on an organized tour to Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi (https://kiberatours.com).<br><br>August 2003 --  I began my trip in Nairobi, where I stayed at the Stanley Hotel, established in 1902 but since substantially remodeled and modernized and lacking the historic charm of the Norfolk Hotel (http://www.sarovahotels.com/stanley-nairobi/).  From Nairobi I drove to the Samburu National Reserve, where it was easy to see the Samburu big five: the gerenuk, Grévy's zebra, beisa oryx, reticulated giraffe and Somali ostrich.  On the drive back to Nairobi, I stopped for lunch at the Mount Kenya Safari Club (http://www.fairmont.com/mount-kenya-safari/) and visited the animal orphanage at the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (http://www.animalorphanagekenya.org/).<br><br>August 1999 --  I started that trip in Nairobi, where I visited the Giraffe Centre, which works to conserve the Rothschild giraffe, the second most endangered giraffe subspecies (http://www.giraffecenter.org/); the Karen Blixen Museum, which was once the home of Isak Dinesen; the Nairobi National Museum; and Nairobi National Park.  I stayed at the Norfolk Hotel, the most historic hotel in the capital (http://www.fairmont.com/norfolk-hotel-nairobi/).  From Nairobi I flew to the Masai Mara Game Reserve, the northern continuation of the Serengeti National Park game reserve in Tanzania (which I visited later on the same trip), and stayed at the Mara Serena Safari Lodge, in the heart of the reserve's Mara Triangle.  From the Masai Mara, I flew back to Nairobi and drove to Amboseli National Park, one of the best parks in Africa to see elephants, where I stayed at Ol Tukai Lodge (http://www.oltukailodge.com/).  I had dinner at the Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi, an open-air steakhouse, the twist being that much of the meat came from animals that visitors seek out on safari, like zebra, waterbuck and hartebeest, although the Carnivore no longer serves exotic game (http://www.tamarind.co.ke/carnivore/).",383

In Kiev, I also visited the Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum.  From Kiev I flew to Lviv, which is also on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, where I stayed at the Grand Hotel, opened in 1893 and the city's most historic (http://grandhotel.lviv.ua/).",326

The wildlife at Queen Elizabeth NP has been decimated over the years, and has begun recovering, but it will take many years before it again is one of the best national parks in Africa -- that being said, I saw some animals that I had not seen at other parks, including Ugandan kob and giant forest hogs.  After a couple of days in Queen Elizabeth NP, we drove to Bwindi Impenetrable NP, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/682), for my first gorilla trek.  From Uganda, we drove into Rwanda.",415

Around the zocalo, I have visited the Metropolitan Cathedral (the largest and oldest cathedral in the Americas), the Palacio Nacional (which contains a famous series of murals by Diego Rivera) and the Palacio de Bellas Artes (likewise).

Manila lacks the charm of most other Asian capitals and has very few historic sights (except for a few in the Intramuros area, like San Agustin Church, a UNESCO World Heritage Site), but is somewhat redeemed by the high quality of its restaurants and bars, like Hobbit House, which offers a wide selection of beer and scotch (http://www.hobbithousemanila.com/).",535

329,111,"October 2015 -- I (unfortunately) visited Cabo San Lucas due to its proximity to the Cabo San Lucas Flora and Fauna Protected Area, part of the Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California UNESCO World Heritage Site.  I wrote &#34;unfortunately visited&#34; since Cabo San Lucas contains, in a small area, the worst aspects of Mexican tourism; every other store is a pharmacy marketing sexual enhancements to visitors, and all of the pharmacies seem to be next door to a brothel masquerading as a massage parlor (there can&#39;t be that many visitors with stiff necks or tired feet!).  Much of old Cabo has been erased, but I did find a historic place to stay, the Cabo Inn Hotel, which opened as a brothel (what else) in 1955 (http://www.caboinnhotel.com).

The trip started with a two-hour drive, mostly through an unimproved wash bed, to Rancho Santa Marta, followed by a one-hour hike and 30-minute climb up a rocky incline to the stunning cave -- due to its remoteness and difficult access the cave is not as frequently visited as some of the more accessible caves in the region, and I was the only visitor at the cave.

Jakarta, one of Asia's least interesting large cities, is the capital of one of the world's most interesting countries.  The most interesting area of Jakarta is its old port area, Sunda Kelapa, which only accommodates pinisi, a traditional double-masted wooden sailing ship serving inter-island freight service within Indonesia.

503,111,"August 2017 -- In the village countryside around Kaiping, two hours by bus from Guangzhou in southern China, stand sentry nearly 1,800 fortified multistory watchtowers, mostly constructed in the 1920s and 1930s with the financial assistance of the Chinese diaspora. In 2007, UNESCO inscribed four of the villages as a World Heritage Site. I visited two of the villages, beginning with Zilicun, where the largest group of watchtowers stands scattered among rice paddies and where a few dozen tourists joined me. I also visited Jinjiangli village, which is home to three well-preserved towers and where, aside from a few elderly residents engaged in chores and ablutions, I had the village to myself.  During my prior visit to Guangzhou's Qingping market in September 1995, the stalls sold every variety of reptile and small mammal (including pangolins, raccoons, dogs and cats) by the overflowing bucket and cage. But since the 2003 SARS outbreak in South China, government officials have cracked down on the open sale of these creatures, so the market no longer seems to be a small zoo that permits visitors to purchase the inhabitants for consumption. Instead the market now less interestingly sells ginseng, deer antlers and desiccated small creatures, like frogs, seahorses and scorpions, so it's not nearly as photogenic as it was.  My favorite meal was dim sum at Guangzhou Restaurant, which opened in 1936 and is a short walk from Qingping market.<br><br>September 1995 -- I spent several weeks in September 1995 in Hong Kong on business, when I made a day trip to Guangzhou, which was about two hours away by train.

I was only able to spend a few minutes on its rocky coast while resting before swimming back to the boat; wider public access to the island is forbidden due to the presence of unexploded military ordnance.

584,111,"August 2017 -- My first stop on my most recent trip to Hong Kong was the lifelike statue of Bruce Lee, erected in November 2005, several years after my prior visit to the city-state in January 2000. The statue shows Lee in his signature sinewed ready-to-strike pose from Fist of Fury, his second major role during an early 1970s string of four influential martial arts films.  The statue is a short walk from Chungking Mansions, where the city's largest collection of guest houses sits above a warren of restaurants and shops that cater to the South Asian, Middle Eastern and African communities. To me, what's most interesting about the building, historically notorious as a den of petty criminals, drug dealers and undocumented immigrants, is that it sits on some of the world's most valuable property, cater-corner to the Peninsula, the city's world-famous hotel, and near high-street jewelry and clothing stores. Other than backpackers searching for inexpensive lodging, most visitors avoid Chungking Mansions, but that need not be so because the food from the subcontinent is delicious and cheap.  During this trip, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a No. 10 typhoon signal, the highest level, which had only been hoisted fourteen other times since 1946 and only twice since 1984.  On the day of the typhoon, I was one of very few customers for dim sum breakfast at Luk Yu Teahouse (which has been serving dim sum since 1933), roast goose for lunch at Yung Kee (established in 1942), and dinner at La Taverna (which opened as Hong Kong's first Italian restaurant in 1969).  During this trip, I also had char sui barbecued pork at two Michelin-recognized hole-in-the-wall restaurants, Joy Hing's Roasted Meat, which has been serving roasted meats for more than a century, and Yat Lok Restaurant; won ton noodle soup at Mak's Noodle, which has been serving its famous soup since the 1920s; egg pudding for breakfast at Australia Dairy Company (established in 1970); and lunch at Spring Deer, which has been serving Peking cuisine since 1969.<br><br>I also made several trips to Hong Kong in the late 1990s, including business trips in September 1995, September 1996 and January 2000, and personal visits in November 1996 and December 1998.

The most interesting part of the city is Central and Western District, located on the northern part of Hong Kong Island, where the Central Market, constructed in Bauhaus style in 1938, was located (this photogenic wet market was closed in March 2003), and where Man Mo Temple, established in the 1840s and the oldest on the island, is located.  During my earlier trips, I ate at several of the the city's historic Chinese restaurants, including Luk Yu Tea House; Yung Kee; Fook Lam Moon; Spring Deer Restaurant, which is known for Peking duck; Great Shanghai Restaurant, one of Hong Kong's oldest Shanghainese restaurants; and Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Aberdeen Harbour.",495

0,23057,"Over the holidays, Sandy and I headed to sunny south Florida for a week in the Everglades.  We left RDU around 630 on Christmas and flew to Miami.  We arrived around 9 and stayed for the first night at an Extended Stay America next to the airport, not the greatest hotel, but good enough for just the evening.  Monday morning, we checked out and headed west along US-41, the Tamiami Trail.  Along the way, I was just amazed at the wildlife we saw in the canal running parallel to the highway – alligators, herons, kingfishers and our first anhinga sighting.  In about 20 miles, we turned into Shark Valley in Everglades National Park.  This is a really popular area of the park so we arrived a little early – around 830 to ensure a parking space and bike availability.  After getting our stuff together, we began bicycling the tram trail.  The loop is about 15 miles total, so a little long to hike in the Florida sun, but just right for bicycling.  But even on bicycles, the going was slow and certainly not because of rough terrain.  The trail was paved and as flat as could be, but we stopped so many times to see wildlife.  We saw lots of alligators, including some babies.  Besides being small, they are easily recognizable by their yellow stripes.  And where there are babies, the mom is nearby keeping an eye on them.  Alligators are one of the only reptile species where the mother watches over her young.  We also saw a large number of wading birds, including great blue herons, green herons, snowy egrets, tricolored herons and more.  In the dry season, the wildlife congregates around the remaining pools of water and makes watching them great.  At one such wet spot, there were a number of white ibises pecking around in the shallow water for prey.  At the half-way point on the tram trail, we parked our bikes and made a stop at the observation tower.  Near the restrooms, I spotted a huge banana spider or golden orb weaver.  A tram had stopped so the observation tower was a bit crowded, but the views from up here were great.  It’s no wonder why the Everglades is referred to as a “river of grass”.  Once we got some pictures, we headed back down and started to finish up the loop.  Along the way back, we spotted many more birds and alligators.  There were a few juvenile white ibises, who have brown instead of white feathers.  At another stop, we saw a number of wood storks.  A local guy who had stopped here said it was unusual to see so many storks at once.  Near the end, one alligator had his mouth wide open showing his teeth right along the trail.  Finishing up the loop, we returned the bicycles and then walked the short Bobcat Boardwalk trail.  Then we left Shark Valley and continued heading west on Tamiami Trail.  Our next stop was the Oasis Visitor Center in Big Cypress National Preserve.  The boardwalk in front of the visitor center was a great spot to see more alligators basking in the sun.  At the far end of the boardwalk, a beautiful female anhinga was perched.  The Oasis center marks the southern terminus of the Florida National Scenic Trail, a more than 1000-mile trail running through the state. While we couldn’t hike it all, I wanted to hike a few miles on it while we were here.  We didn’t go far though as it got really overgrown and there were lots of bugs out.  We did see a few pretty butterflies though, bugs I don't mind.  The white peacock butterfly was really beautiful.  And the Gulf Fritillaries have a bright orange color.  Next, we headed to the Big Cypress Swamp Welcome Center for Big Cypress.  Here, we joined Ranger Lisa for a short talk about mangroves and manatees.  Then we drove the Turner River-Wagon Wheel loop scenic drive and again saw many birds and gators along the canals.  The Turner River runs along the canal and there were lots of birds, including gallinules and egrets.  Back on Tamiami Trail, we continued west to Everglades City and checked into our hotel – Ivey House.  We had dinner at Triad Seafood Market.  I had gator bites and Sandy had stone crab and we enjoyed our dinner outside and enjoyed the sunset views.  Then we retired for the evening, getting in one last shower at Ivey House.
Tuesday morning, we woke up and had a great breakfast at Ivey House before checking out.  It was just a short drive to the Gulf Coast Visitor Center.  Here we met with Dave and the others in our camping group.  After getting our stuff safely in dry bags and packing the kayaks, we paddled out across Chokoloskee Bay.  Due to low tide, it was very mucky getting into the kayak.  Once across the bay, we started paddling out towards the Gulf of Mexico through Indian Key Pass.  This is also the route used by the tourist boats from Everglades City, so we had to stay to the side.  Dolphins like chasing the motor boats - kayaks are too slow for them - but we did see some chasing the boats.  Since the tide was coming in, paddling through Indian Key Pass was difficult.  We stopped for lunch on a shell mound and then made the last strenuous bit to get out to the Gulf of Mexico.  In the distance was One Tree Island.  Formerly connected to one of the Sand Key islands nearby, a hurricane had washed out the land between and now the island was so small, only a single tree grew here.  Getting out of the channel, it was a little easier and we paddled another mile or so to Picnic Key, our home for the next two nights.  Once on shore, we set up our tent on the beach a good ways back from the high tide line.  While we were swimming in the warm Gulf waters, Dave made a delicious dinner of stone crab, fried grouper, and salad.  I’m not a big fan of seafood, but it was very good.  Normally when camping, I eat Raman noodles or Beefaroni, so having real food was great.  After dinner, we relaxed on the beach and watched the sunset.  At about this time, the wind and waves calmed down and the bugs got pretty bad – lots of mosquitoes and no-see-ums.  Seeking shelter in our tent, we waited an hour or so and the bugs died down a bit and we went for a short walk.  It had been a long day and so we went to bed early.
Wednesday, we woke up around sunrise and the bugs were back.  Sandy and I stayed in our tent for a while and watched the raccoons out on the beach.  All food was safely stored in the kayaks, so the raccoons headed into the surf to look for crabs for breakfast.  Since there’s no freshwater on the island, they would drink dew off leaves.  As the sun rose in the sky, the bugs died down and Dave made a great breakfast of eggs and bacon.  After eating, we started our paddling tour of the Ten Thousand Islands.  We first headed northwest to Round Key.  It was low tide so a sandbar was sticking out where a number of pelicans and gulls were resting.  After a short break, our next destination was Camp Lulu Key, where we would eat lunch.  Surprisingly, there was a building here.  Apparently, someone came out with a boat and built a house here.  The park service let him squat for a while before finally kicking him out.  The house was all boarded up, but the porch made a nice spot for lunch.  The beach was really pretty here, with one side facing the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the other looking deep into the Ten Thousand Islands.  After lunch, we continued our paddling.  Dave led us through a mangrove tunnel, hoping to find some roseate spoonbills, but no luck.  We spotted a manatee from a distance but too far for a picture.  We then continued back to Picnic Key.  While swimming off our beach, I saw a fish apparently jump really high in the air.  We had seen lots of jumping fish – mullets, I believe – but they only jumped a foot or two in the air.  This one must have been six to eight feet.  Just as he crashed back to the water, a dolphin popped out and ate him.  The fish hadn’t jumped that high – I think the dolphin knocked him out of the water.  For dinner, Dave made jambalaya with sausage and shrimp. Since the bugs were pretty bad the night before, we gathered some driftwood to make a bonfire, which helped quite a bit.  We enjoyed one last sunset from Picnic Key and stayed close to the bonfire to keep the bugs away.  Once they died down, we went for another evening walk on the beach.  With a new moon and no light pollution, the views of the stars were fantastic.  Then we headed to bed.  With the fire built below the high tide line, the waves washed all trace away.
Thursday morning, we woke up again before sunrise.  The views were beautiful, but the bugs were back.  Dave made another great breakfast of French toast and cinnamon buns and then we broke down camp.  At low tide, the water was too far out to easily get in our boats.  So we waited and enjoyed the beach for an hour or so.  As the tide came in, we started paddling back.  Dave took us a different way back and we spotted some dolphins and pelicans on the way.  We stopped at an island near the beginning of Indian Key Pass for lunch.  It would be a lot easier going back in as we would be going with the tide instead of against it.  And sure enough, we were back to the Gulf Coast Visitor Center in no time.  We unpacked the kayaks and helped Dave load everything in his van and then said good-bye to our new friends.  Sandy and I headed back towards Miami on US-41 and then went south to Homestead, checking in to the Hampton Inn.  A shower felt so great after camping and swimming in salt water the past two nights.
Friday, we had planned to go snorkeling at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park.  Due to unfavorable weather, the trip was cancelled so, we instead went back to Everglades, entering at the main entrance just west of Homestead.  We first stopped at the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where a ranger suggested we head to Royal Palm.  Arriving here, all the cars were covered in tarps.  Apparently, the resident black vultures attack cars and try to remove windshield wipers and weather stripping.  There were no bungee cords left, but we were able to wrap the rental car with a tarp and close it in the car doors.  Once the car was secure, we started hiking the Anhinga Trail – a short boardwalk with lots of wildlife.  Anhingas, the trail’s namesake, are very interesting birds with a long pointed beak used to spear prey.  We spotted one anhinga with an impaled fish on his beak.  Now that he had caught his prey, he needed to get it off so he could eat it.  Near here was a beautiful strangler fig right along the trail.  Further along we spotted a number of alligators as well as cormorants, herons, and vultures.  The open views of the Taylor Slough were just beautiful.  After finishing the short boardwalk, we then hiked the Gumbo Limbo Trail.  Although both trail are right next to each other, they each explore a different landscape.  While the Anhinga Trail lead through an open swampy area, the Gumbo Limbo Trail was through a dense hardwood hammock.  There were several of the distinctive red-orange trees for which the trail is named.  Once we finished the trail, we headed back to the main road and continued towards Flamingo.  Our next stop was the Pinelands, another short interpretive trail that led through an “island” of pine forest.  We heard lots of birds in here, but the forest was too dense for a good view.  We also spotted some Bahama Senna blooming right along the trail.  Then we continued to Pay-Hay-Okee Overlook with great views of the River of Grass.  Pay-hay-okee is a Seminole word for ""grassy waters"" and we had a nice view of the Shark River Slough from the elevated observation tower.  On the short walk back, we passed through a cypress swamp.  It's just amazing how different ecosystems lie so close together.  By this time, it was getting later in the day and we were hungry so we continued to Flamingo and had lunch at Buttonwood Café.  It was damaged in a hurricane and there wasn’t a lot of seating, so we were seated with a German couple for lunch.  After lunch, we hiked the Guy Bradley Trail along Florida Bay to the campground.  Near the entrance to the campground was an impressive nest with two ospreys.  And a number of black vultures were drying their wings.  After some pictures, we made our way back and departed the Everglades.  We had dinner in Homestead at Sake Sushi and Thai and then got packed for a flight home in the morning.",95
1,23057,"Monday morning, we woke up and went to Bobis along the Riva Promenade for some pastries for breakfast. The storm the night before had cleared out and it was just beautiful along the riva. I was surprised to see all the beautiful palm trees along here.  After eating, we swung by a bank ATM to withdraw kuna and then headed to Diocletian's Palace.  As one of the top tourist attractions in Split, it was quite crowded.  Vendors were set up all along the pedestrian streets in the palace, but it was too crowded to really browse.  So we bought tickets to explore the basement areas.  We first walked around the western wing.  This ancient palace was really beautiful and it was just amazing to be walking around such an old structure.  Despite its age, the palace was in remarkably good shape and the supporting columns and structures were beautiful.  A number of old artifacts were laying about in the basement area, including old bowls, stone plaques, and sarcophagi.  A few 3500-year old sphinxes were found in this area, which the emperor had procured from Egypt.  Unfortunately, most were beheaded as later Christians considered them idols.  In a couple spots of the basement, parts of the palace had collapsed, but fortunately, restoration work is in progress.  We also found a bust of Diocletian himself, though I don't think that dated from his era.  After exploring this side for a while, we headed over to the east wing that had similar features but not as many rooms were open.  Here, we saw a couple of people dressed as Roman soldiers and followed them outside to where they had a short performance with the emperor himself coming out to address the crowd.  Out here in the courtyard was an intact sphinx from Egypt, one of the only that wasn't beheaded.  At one part of the courtyard, beautiful flowers were growing up the walls.  Exploring further around the palace, we headed through the vestibule and came across a jewelry shop where a lady was making glass jewelry.  It was interesting watching her work with the glass and I bought Sandy a pendant before we left.  Next, we headed to the cathedral to see some of the other sights.  Our first stop was the treasury that had a number of beautiful artifacts on display, but no photography was permitted.  The relics of Saint Domnius as well as beautiful chalices and and ornate crosses, paintings, and old manuscripts.   Next, we walked though the cathedral which was truly beautiful, inside and out.  There were several altars that were so elaborate.  This is one of the oldest Catholic cathedrals in the world still in its original structure.  From here, we headed up the bell tower.  Initially, we climbed up some very narrow and steep stone stairs up about half way and then climbed up metal stairs to the top.  It was crowded, but at each point we stopped, the views just kept getting better and better.  First, we ascended to the level of nearby rooftops, then a higher above the roofs and finally to the top with great 360-degree views of Split and the surrounding mountains.  We could see all the buildings with their orange roofs, Marjan hill in the distance and the gorgeous coastline.  A storm was brewing and it was fantastic watching the clouds roll in from here.  Looking down, I could see the open ceiling of the vestibule we had walked down earlier.  Heading back down the stairs, we descended into the crypt, which was the former mausoleum of Emperor Diocletian.  Finally, we swung by the Temple of Jupiter that had been converted into a baptistery dedicated to St. John.  The ceiling inside the temple was really ornate and beautiful.  As we left the temple, it started raining lightly and we were getting hungry so we got lunch nearby.  Seafood is very popular along the Dalmatian coast, but I'm not a big fan.  Fortunately, there’s a strong Italian influence so I was always able to find something I liked.  After a late lunch, we swung by the office for Portal Tours to pay for our tours for the week and get our vouchers.  Then we started walking towards Marjan Hill.  There were a lot of stairs and uphill through the old Veli Varoš district to Vidilica cafe.  The overlooks here provided great views of Split and the harbor down below, but this is only part of the way up the hill.  Trails and roads lead up the hill and it was a very pleasant hike.  Along the way, we saw lots of enormous aloe plants.  We also passed by the Church of St. Nicholas.  It was a small church and the door was locked so we couldn't go inside, but I put my camera through a hole to get a picture of the interior.  Continuing on, the trail came out at the site of a former zoo and then led up to the top of Marjan Hill where the Croatian flag was flying.  From up here, we had a great view of Split from above, but the view west towards the sunset was blocked.  So after a few pictures, we headed back down and had dinner and cocktails along the Riva.  The harbor was beautiful at night.  After dinner, we headed to bed as we had a long day planned for tomorrow.

Tuesday morning, we woke up early and grabbed some pastries from Bobis before heading to the bus stop for our tour to Plitvice Lakes.  It’s a long drive – 3 to 4 hours – so we had to start early.  Our tour guide was Mario and our driver was Tiho.  We absolutely loved them – our favorite guides of the week.  During the long drive, Mario kept us entertained by teaching us about Croatian history and culture and a few words in Croatian (though he wouldn’t teach us any bad words!).  Right away, we passed by the fortress of Klis, which is where Mereen in Game of Thrones is filmed.  As we headed deeper into hinterland, Mario pointed out how the trees and plantlife were stunted due to high winds coming off the sea.  We made a quick stop for snacks at a gas station near Maslenica where we could see the Velebit Mountains.  We would pass through this mountain shortly.  After our stop, we drove through Sveti Rok Tunnel, passing through the Velebit Mountains.  This was the longest tunnel in Croatia at nearly 6 km.   Through the tunnel, we left the Dalmatia region and entered Lika.  On this side of the mountain, protected from the strong winds by the mountains, the land was all forested.  Amazing what a difference the side of the mountain makes.  We continued for another hour or so, finally arriving at Plitvice Lakes National Park around 11 at entrance 2.  After Mario got our tickets, we entered the park and took a short boat ride across Lake Kozjak to begin our hike around the Upper Lakes.  Boardwalks wrap around the many lakes here, each separated by the most beautiful waterfalls.  The park was very crowded, despite being shoulder season, so walking around on the boardwalks was slow going.  We passed by a few smaller, presumably unnamed waterfalls, and soon arrived at the first named waterfall Veliki Prštavac, at 28 m high.  This is the second highest waterfall in the park.  It was a real beauty, but was flowing strongly and produced a lot of mist.  Continuing on, we then made it to Mali Prštavac, a similar waterfall at 18 m.  Next, we came to Galova&#269;ki Buk.  Although not particularly high, I thought this was the most beautiful waterfall in the park.  A dozen or more streams of water tumbled down from one lake to the next into the most beautiful turquoise pool of water.  This was such a beautiful scene and truly captured the stunning beauty of Plitvice Lakes.  Heading further up along the lakes, we saw many more small, unnamed waterfalls.  Arriving at essentially the top, we made a short restroom stop and waited a short time for the shuttle bus.  It was a bit chaotic getting on the bus - Mario advised me to use my tripod to whack other tourist and ensure our group go on the bus.  The shuttle took us all the way down to the past the upper lakes and parked at the lower lakes.  From here, we followed gravel road down to lake level.  Another trail, mostly composed of boardwalks led past the lower lakes.  We first passed Milanova&#269;ki Slap waterfall, which drained into a most beautiful lake.  The water here is so clear and green.  A number of fish, European Chub I believe, could be seen in the water.  Continuing on, we passed more small cascades and the beautiful turquoise water before heading to the big waterfall.  Veliki Slap is the highest waterfall in the park at 78 m.  Of course it was very crowded, but we climbed on some rocks to get some good pictures of this massive waterfall.  Then we started heading back towards entrance 1 where Tiho would pick us up.  Heading back up the gorge, we passed a couple more overlooks of Veliki Slap from a distance.  Although the lighting was poor, it was a great view of this waterfall and really put perspective on its massive size.  We could see not only the main drop that we could see from the base, but also additional cascades and drops downstream.  Back at the bus, we went a short ways to lunch at Vila Velebita.  It was a late lunch by around 4 when we arrived and we were all very hungry.  But the food was really delicious and nice to have something more traditionally Croatian.  After lunch, we started making the long drive back to Split.  On the way, Mario opened the bar so we could purchase beer or wine on the ride back.  I had a Velebitsko Temno.  Mario claimed it was the best beer in Europe, but having been in Munich for Oktoberfest, I was a bit skeptical.  But after tasting it, I agreed – it was great.  Unfortunately, I’m not sure I can get it back home.  Mario gave us some more information about Croatia’s history on the ride home and we made one more stop for a sunset view over Krka River.  As we approached Split, Mario handed us a note that Tiho was a good singer and we should ask him to sing us a song.  Tiho sang O Sole Mio for us as we drove through Split back to the bus stop.  It had been a long day so we headed back to the hotel after our tour and went to bed.

Wednesday morning we slept in a bit and then had breakfast out on the Riva.  Around 10, we headed to the South Gate of Diocletian’s Palace to get picked up for our canyoneering adventure.  Our shuttle took us over to the small town of Zadvarje and we had about a 20 minute break to use the restrooms and grab a snack.  Then we headed to the tour office for a safety briefing and to get our gear – wet suits for the cold water, a PFD, and a helmet.  Once we were all geared up, they drove us to the start of our adventure.  It was quite warm in the wet suits, so the cold water was a bit of a relief.  We hike down into the gorge and soon starting canyoneering down Cetina River.  The water was chilly but wearing a wet suit kept us warm enough.  Almost immediately we had to jump into a deep pool and then rock hop and wade further down.  There were several spots to jump into the water as well as a couple water slides to enjoy.  In slow-moving sections of the river, we just floated downstream.  About half way down the river, we stopped for a break on some big rocks and then got out of the water and headed into a narrow tunnel.  This river was used extensively for hydroelectric power generation and the there was evidence all around.  In fact, the tiny village of Zadvarje had power before Split thanks to the river's power.  We used this tunnel to get around Gubavica, a large waterfall on Cetina River.  Back at the river, we headed upstream a bit to the base of Gubavica.  There was a big rock here to climb up and jump into the deep pool at the base of the falls.  After a few jumps here, we continued downstream.  There were a few more rock hop and swimming sections and then we came to another spot where we had to climb a ridge to get around.  There were ropes to assist with the steep climb up and then back down, reminding me of some of the more difficult waterfall hikes back home.  Soon we came back to a rather flat section of the river near the end of our adventure.  We floated downstream a bit and passed a tall waterfall.  It comes from the overflow of the dam, so it’s not a real waterfall, but was really pretty nonetheless.  At this point, we got out of the water and followed a trail to once last wade across the river and then up to the road where the shuttles were waiting to bring us back.  We changed clothes and then headed back to Zadvarje and then were shuttled back to Split.  We took showers and then headed to dinner in the evening.  We stopped by a grocery store to pick up some wine and had drinks down by the Riva.

Thursday morning, we woke up early again and ate breakfast down at the Riva.  After breakfast, we headed to the bus stop for our tour of Krka National Park and &#348;ibenik.  Our tour guide today was Ernest and our driver was George.  Leaving Split, we first stopped at Trogir to pick up some additional folks.  This is Ernest’s home and he had lots to tell us about this little town.  We continued on away from the coast and into Krka National Park.  We first stopped at Skradinski Buk, Krka’s largest and most well-known waterfall.  This is the last waterfall on Krka River before it flows into the Adriatic Sea.  Our quick stop for a sunset view two days earlier was just a short ways downstream from this waterfall.  We started off near the top and made a clockwise loop on the trail around the waterfall.  The Church of St. Nicholas was near the start.  Skradinski Buk has a number of cascading sections, each one quite beautiful.  I don't there's anywhere to see the entire thing.  Although there were several old mills and other buildings around the falls, I didn’t they distracted much from the scene.  We slowly worked our way down after viewing each of the cascades and drops.  At the bottom, we crossed the footbridge over the river to the base at the pool below the falls.  Unlike Plitvice Lakes, swimming is permitted, and I had to take the opportunity to take a dip.  The water was quite cold and the current was surprisingly strong.  It was hard to stop for a picture without getting swept downstream.  I didn’t stay in long as it was too chilly, however.  After drying off, we started heading back up the other side.  It was more natural on this side with none of the mills or old buildings here.  We saw beautiful travertine cliffs as we were heading up.  There was another really scenic waterfall along the way on a small tributary of Krka River.  Soon we got to probably the best view spot of Skradinski Buk – perched up on a cliff, the waterfall, footbridge, and old buildings made a beautiful scene.  And yet, even here, we could only see a portion of the entire waterfall.  Continuing on, the boardwalk trails looped around past scenic little ponds and small drops, but nothing else too big.  There was one area with a huge number of wildflowers blooming.  Finishing up the loop, we made a quick stop at the old mill.  We then headed back to the bus to continue exploring the park.  Driving north, we made a quick stop to view the Visovak Island, containing a 14th monastery.  The island is not completely natural – the monks added rocks over the years to increase the size of the island.  The views here of the island, monastery, and Krka river were great.  After a couple pictures, we continued on to Roški Slap.  Here we had a traditional buffet lunch with bread, cheese, olives, and meat.  We even had some local sherry and wine.  After lunch we took some time to explore.  First, we hiked the rather steep Niz Plo&#269;u trail up to a great overlook of the Krka River.  Although steep and rocky, I stopped a couple times to enjoy the view and check out the chimney bellflower blooming along the trail.  In the distance, the river flowed between two mountains that almost looked like a wall that had been broken by the river.  Heading back down, we swung by the boat dock to see Roški Slap waterfall.  The view wasn’t ideal from here; I think the only way to get a good view of this waterfall would be from a boat.  We swung by the gift shop and picked up a couple little bottles of sherry to take home.  Then we got back in the bus and left the park en route to the historic town of &#348;ibenik.  We stopped near the docks and followed Ernest toward the town square and the Cathedral of St. James, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Ernest provided some history of this beautiful church, pointing out some of the beautiful architectural features.  The building was unfortunately damaged in the war, but was being restored.  We then took a quick walk through the inside of the cathedral to see the beautiful altar and interior.  Outside, I got a picture of many of the stone heads on the side of the building.  Then we headed up to the Medieval Garden of St. Lawrence Monastery.  It's a very small garden, but quite scenic right in the old town of &#348;ibenik.  Firethorn and other pretty flowers were blooming in the garden and a small cafe provided a spot to get a drink and relax.  After a few minutes, we headed back to the bus to head back to Split.  It was a lovely drive along the coast between &#348;ibenik and Split as we made out way back.

Friday was an early morning as we had a long day heading to Dubrovnik.  Our tour guide today was Igor and our driver was Ivan.  After everyone was boarded on the bus, we headed south.  We made a bathroom and snack break at the highest gas station in Croatia where we could see the towering Biokovo Mountains, the second highest mountain range in Croatia.  From here, we continued south to our first stop in the small town of Ston.  A defensive stone wall was built around the town that looked like a miniature version of China’s Great Wall.  In town, Igor pointed out a couple places to stop.  First we hit up a bakery to pick up some pastries and meat pies to eat.  Then we swung by the wine store to get some Croatian wine to bring home before exploring the small town.  Walking south out of the walls, we could see the salt pans.  We didn't really have enough time to walk through so just got some pictures from the street.  Down one street, we could see the Church of St. Blaise.  Originally built in around 1340, the church has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes, most recently in 1996.  And like many times in the preceding centuries, the church was being restored.   We walked around the town a bit more along the walls and spotted some amazing cactus growing up along the city walls.  But then it was time, so we headed back to the bus and continue towards Dubrovnik.  Continuing on, we passed through a small section of Bosnia-Herzegovina and then back into Croatia.  The drive along the coast here was absolutely beautiful and soon we were headed into Dubrovnik.  Dubrovnik is always crowded and a couple cruise ships were in port, so it was even more crowded than usual, despite being shoulder season.  We got dropped off at the bus stop near an interesting fountain with statues of Pan and Nymph.  Starting our exploration of the city, Igor took us around the old town of the city for about an hour.  He provided some fascinating history of the city and pointed out several landmarks throughout the city, including the the stairs where Cersei Lannister did her Walk of Atonement in Game of Thrones.  Dubrovnik is the setting for Kings Landing and we recognized many spots from the show.  He also showed us many of the beautiful churches located in the city.  The Dubrovnik Cathedral was one of the most beautiful.  When Igor was finished, we had some free time to explore the city and headed up to the famous city walls.  Starting out in the eastern end of the walls near the harbor, we headed up and walked around the walls in the counterclockwise direction.  Up here, we had amazing views of the city.  The walls span the perimeter of the city and we spent about an hour and a half walking around.  There were several old cannons up here, indicating the defensive nature of these walls.  The bright orange roofs of the buildings of Dubrovnik made a spectacular sight from the walls.  About halfway through, we stopped at Min&#269;eta Tower.  Climbing up to the top was the highest point on the walls and provided the best views.  Continuing on, we could see Lovrijenac Fort, which is detached from the old town.  Standing tall on a cliff high above the sea, this old fortress was stunningly beautiful.  The last section of the walls was along the coast and we could see the rocky water far below.  At one point high above the rugged rocky coast, we watched some people jump into the ocean from the cliffs.  When we finished the walls, we headed back to the old town.  We visited the Church of St. Ignatius with the most beautiful interior.  The ceiling above the altar was painted with a heavenly scene and reminded me of the Sistine Chapel.  Then we continued through town to Lovrijenac Fort, just outside the old town.  There were many stairs to climb up but the views of the Old Town were great from here.  It really put into perspective the scope of the city walls we had walked earlier.  After some pictures, it was getting to be about time so we headed back, passing the West Harbor of Dubrovnik.  Returning to the bus, we made the long drive home but Igor told us some stories and history of Croatia to pass the time.

Saturday was our last full day in Croatia and today we were doing a boat tour of the many islands off the coast of Split.  We boarded the speedboat at 830 with our guide Martko.  We first stopped at &#268;iovo island near Trogir to pick up some other visitors and then made the rather long boat ride to the island of Biševo to see the Blue Cave.  The Blue Cave is illuminated from around 11 to 12 so we had to go here first to see the cave under optimal lighting conditions.  The boat was cruising at about 25 MPH so it got a little chilly with the wind.  In about 2 hours, we made it to Biševo and had a quick break.  The views here of Vis in the distance were really nice.  We then boarded a smaller boat to head to the cave.  The Blue Cave has a very small entrance and so larger boats can’t get in.  Even in the small boat, we had to duck down when entering.  Inside the cave, sunlight penetrated the water outside the cave and illuminated the cave in a beautiful blue light.  It was amazing to see and hard to believe that it’s natural lighting.  After a quick run through the cave, we returned to the dock and re-boarded our tour boat.  Martko took us over to the fishing village of Komiža on the island of Vis.  We had about an hour here, so we walked around the town, first visiting Komuna, the fishing museum.  They had some interesting exhibits but the highlight was the view from the top.  Then we stopped by Gusarica beach and relaxed for a bit to enjoy the view of the bay.  Back at the boat, we continued around Vis and made a quick stop at Stiniva beach, rated as the best in Europe.  Tucked back away in cove protected by cliffs, it's no wonder it was rated highly.  Our next stop was at the Green Cave on the island of Ravnik.  This cave is much larger than Blue Cave and bigger boats were able to get in.  A small hole in the roof of the cave allowed sunlight to get in, creating an interesting green spot in the water.  A few people were in the water swimming, but with multiple boats in here, swimming didn't seem safe.  As we were leaving the cave, we saw some people on top of the cave, jumping into the water.  It was getting into the afternoon and we were getting hungry so our next stop was the small island Budikovac, with a population of one.  A rather eccentric gentleman lives here year round with his donkeys and some other livestock.  We had lunch here and then took some time to swim and snorkel in the beautiful water.  The water was very cold, but so crystal clear and I spotted a few fish while snorkeling.  It was too cold to stay in long.  Our last stop was the city of Hvar on the island of the same name.  We first walked past the Church of St. Stephen and then made the hike up to the fortress.  Along the way, we passed an old church; I never figured out a name for this one.  At the fortress, we first headed down into the prison.  There were several small cells, including a torture chamber.  Then we went up to the top of the fortress for amazing views overlooking Hvar and the harbor.  After a few pictures, we headed back into town just walked around the beautiful old city for a bit.  Passing the Benedictine Monastery, there was a statue of a monk praying outside.  When it was time, we got back on the boat and headed back to Split.  There was some type of regatta going on and we passed a number of sailboats as we headed back to Split.  For our last dinner in Split, we ate at Fife.  It was buffet style, but the food was really good.  After that, we had one more drink along the Riva to enjoy sunset and then headed back to the room to pack.  Sunday was long day in many airports, but we made it home without any incidents.",254
2,23057,"On Wednesday, we were heading into Alabama to get some waterfalls in another state.  We drove towards Chattanooga and took I-59 south through Georgia and into Alabama.  We first headed to Gadsden to see Noccalula Falls.  The impressive 90-foot waterfall is right in town.  The city has a park here, complete with petting zoo and mini-golf.  But we were only here to see the waterfall, so rather than paying to enter the park, we just walked over to see the waterfall.  We would have had to wait for it to open as well.  A statue near the rim was of a Cherokee woman, Noccalula for whom the falls is named, jumping over the edge.  According to legend, she killed herself rather than marry a man she didn’t love.  We got some pictures here and walked over to the footbridge over the river above the falls.  Then we headed north to Little River Canyon National Preserve.  We entered on AL-176 at Eberhart Point and followed the rim drive north.  We first stopped at the overlook for Grace’s High Falls.  From across the Bear Creek Gorge, we could see the waterfall tumbling off the cliff.  Although it’s a seasonal waterfall, when it's flowing, it’s the highest in the state of Alabama at 133 feet and today it was flowing well.  As we were getting ready to leave, a turkey vulture flew right by us and I was able to get a picture before he flew off.  We continued on and stopped at a couple of the overlooks.  First we stopped at the Wolf Creek Overlook for views on the west end of the Wolf Creek gorge.  Then we stopped on the other side at Canyon View.  Next, we stopped at Lynn Overlook with more great views of the Little River Canyon.  And then finally, we stopped at the Little River Falls Overlook.  Although the waterfall was a ways upstream, the viewpoint was pretty good.  We stopped one more time at the parking area for Little River Falls and went down for some pictures of the waterfall close up.  This impressive river-wide waterfall is split into two streams and it was really flowing today.  After a few pictures, we continued north to DeSoto Falls.  I got a tip from a friend, so instead of going to the main viewing area, we parked along the road and followed a trail to the base.  The trail started past some huge cliffs and then led down to the river.  There were some beautiful azaleas blooming.  It was just a short ways along the river to the base of this beautiful 100-foot waterfall.  Our friends who had visited recently had gone swimming, but it was way too cold today.  We had a snack and I climbed around on the rocks to get pictures from different angles.  There were some beautiful irises blooming near the waterfall.  Along the way back, we passed some people rock climbing on the cliffs.  Back at the car, we continued a short ways to the the regular viewing area.  It was a view of the top, including the A. A. Miller Dam and some cascades above the main drop.  We followed the path to the overlook and had to stretch to get an unobstructed view of the main waterfall.  From here, we headed into the main part of DeSoto State Park and parked at the Talmadge Butler Boardwalk trailhead.  We followed this boardwalk to the first of several small waterfalls in the park.  Azalea Cascade was just a small slide between some big boulders.  We got on the blue-blazed Lost Falls Trail and hiked about a mile to the next waterfall.  Lost Falls is a small waterfall and the first of several on Laurel Creek.  Although it's not big, it's pretty as it falls over the rock ledges.  We crossed the creek above the waterfall and followed the orange-blazed Laurel Falls Trail to this waterfall.  We could have just as easily seen it coming in from the Lost Falls Trail.  This small waterfall had a lot of moss and algae growing on the rocks over which it fell.  We finished up the loop and took the boardwalk back to the parking area.  We crossed the street here and headed down to Indian Falls.  A footbridge led over the falls, so we had to climb down to get a good view.  This 20-foot waterfall was very scenic, the last one on Laurel Creek before it flows into West Fork Little River.  From here, we got on the DeSoto Scout Trail and followed the river downstream a bit, then took the violet Wildflower Trail to Lodge Falls.  The top of the waterfall had a small, but scenic drop.  It seemed like there was more to it downstream.  I tried climbing down all the way to the river, but there was really nothing else to see.  So we headed back to the car and drove further into the park for one more waterfall.  We parked at the trailhead for Gilliam Loop Trail and followed this trail for a half-mile or so.  Then we turned on DST Exit 1 and followed this down to DeSoto Scout Trail.  It was relatively level at first, but got extremely steep before reaching river level.  We got on DeSoto Scout Trail and followed West Fork Little River downstream.  Almost immediately, looking across the river, we could see what looked like a waterfall on the other side.  But there was no way to get across the river in such high water for a closer look.  Following the trail, we soon came to Poison Ivy Falls.  This tall waterfall flows over a high cliff, forming a rockhouse behind the falls.  I’m not sure how the waterfall got its name and I didn’t want to find out.  After a few pictures, we continued on and took DST Exit 2 to head back.  Along the way, we heard something and got off trail to find a small 10-foot waterfall on an unnamed tributary.  We called it Rhododendron Falls, because it was so covered in rhododendron that it was hard to get a picture.  We then finished our hike up and headed back to the car.  Driving back to Cleveland, we stopped in town for dinner at Five Point Square before heading back to the hotel.",83
3,23057,"Saturday, I headed to Pilot Mountain State Park for a nice late-winter hike. It was the first time this year I had the opportunity to hike outside of the Raleigh area. We met in the Chapel Hill area at 8 and carpooled out to Pilot Mountain, parking at the Corridor Trailhead parking along Pinnacle Hotel Road. We arrived a little after 930. Once everyone used the restrooms and got their stuff together, we started off on the trail around 10. Hiking across Pinnacle Hotel Road, we started on the red-blazed Mountain Trail. At the first intersection, we turned left to hike around the mountain. This was my first time hiking Pilot Mountain in the winter, though it didn’t feel much like winter. The temperatures were in the 60s and it was unseasonably warm. But the lack of leaves made for lovely winter views. It had also been a while since I had hiked at Pilot Mountain. The last time I was here, several years ago, the Mountain Trail was different. Back then, it led from the Corridor Trailhead parking to Ledge Springs Trail. Now, the Mountain Trail wrapped further around the mountain, intersecting with Grindstone Trail, a half-mile or so below the split with Ledge Springs Trail. Additionally, another part of the loop leads from the Visitor Center at the end of Grindstone Trail back around to the Corridor Trailhead parking lot. Hiking up the flank on Mountain Trail, we could see the distinctive monadnock peak high above. There were also great views of the surrounding countryside. In about 2 miles, we came to the rocky portion of the trail, below the cliffs of Ledge Springs Trail. In the past, the Mountain Trail had terminated near here, but not it went another mile or so to end at Grindstone Trail. When we made it to the end, we turned right on Grindstone Trail to head up to the summit. Most people in the group continued on Grindstone Trail, but John and I took the more scenic Ledge Springs Trail. Hiking below the massive cliffs and climbing over large rocks and stairs, I think this is the best trail in the park. We saw a handful of rock climbers scaling the rocky cliffs and soon made it to Jomeokee Trail at the saddle between the Big and Little Pinnacle. We turned right on Jomeokee Trail and once over to the Big Pinnacle, we found a nice rock outcrop to sit and eat lunch. Across the saddle, we could see the Little Pinnacle Overlook with people enjoying the view. After lunch, we made a quick loop around the Big Pinnacle. There are great views of the surrounding Piedmont landscape. The massive cliffs that make up the Big Pinnacle are quite impressive close up. From a distance, you don’t get a good idea of how big they are. We could see, but not hear, a raptor roosting high above. I also found a really cool tree growing out of the side of the cliffs. Once we finished the loop, we started heading back. We made a quick stop at Little Pinnacle Overlook for great views of the Big Pinnacle and the Sauratown Mountains in the background. Then we headed to the summit parking lot to take the Grindstone Trail back down. I stopped for one more picture from an overlook, then we started hiking down. We followed Grindstone Trail all the way back down to the visitor center, briefly got on the Grassy Ridge Trail and then picked up the Mountain Trail back to our cars. Total distance was about 10.5 miles. The weather had been so nice, it was great to feel like spring was finally on its way.",123

15,2297,"Following is my syndicated newspaper, written following the second of three visits I have made to Haiti:…………………………….
THE POOR OF HAITI ARE RICH IN FAITH …………  PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI:  It was Saturday morning in Haiti and the streets of Port-au-Prince were crowded.

I found it to be a colorful, clamoring place, and utterly fascinating.  An independent nation since 1804, Haiti is the oldest Negro republic in the world.  Poor, superstitious, and violent, it is a virtual Africa of the West Indies.  At our doorstep, Haiti is much closer to America than some states are from one another.

I had read and heard enough about this Caribbean land that I was prepared for most of the sights we saw.  When Columbus discovered the mountainous island of Hispaniola in 1492, he called it  the most beautiful land human eyes have ever seen.  Five centuries later it still maintains an incredible beauty, amidst an astonishing poverty.  With an annual per capita income of only $260, the Hatian people are the poorest in the western Hemisphere.  A crowded land, Haiti has approximately the same population as the state of Georgia, about six million, but less than one fifth the land area.  And two thirds of the land of Haiti is too rugged for human habitation.

The most frightening tales to come out of Haiti concern witchcraft and voodoo, with allusions to demon possession and human sacrifice.  Just the night before we had heard the rhythmic voodoo drums with their satanic bet coming from the mountain behind the mission compound where we stayed.

Now, with a missionary guide, we wound our way through the city streets.  Our destination was the Rue du Centre Church of God.  Every Saturday morning is a time for fasting and prayer at this 6,000 plus member church, the largest Protestant congregation in the republic.  Of all the sights and sounds of Haiti, that which I was about to experience would catch me most by surprise – wonderfully so.

Before we saw the church I heard it.  More than a block away, the streets were filled with the sound of singing.  I could not understand the Creole language, but the tune was unmistakable:  Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou Art. It is a song that is a favorite in many lands.

The church building was a simple, yet imposing structure.  The six double doorways leading into the sanctuary were open and hundreds of people stood in them, spilling out on the street, unable to get inside.  Even those outside the building were lifting their hands toward heaven, worshiping and praising their God.  I was led through a side entrance onto the platform from which I could see 3,500 radiant smiling faces.  People stood around the sides, sat in the aisles, and literally hung from the balcony railing.  Tomorrow morning this churh would hold its first service at 5:30 a.m. in order to accommodate the larger Sunday attendance.

It was both an honor and a humbling experience to be able to address such a congregation.  In the United States we sometimes have prayer breakfasts and are able to get a few people to attend.  But this scene is an every Saturday occurrence in Port-au-Prince, a morning of fasting and prayer.  

I had to preach through an interpreter.  But first I gave a greeting in French – a tradition in many Hatian chuches:  Benis soil L’eternal,  (Blessed be the Eternal One).  

Benis sois L’eternal! Th congregation shouted back in in unison, hands and voices lifted in praise.

I could not stop the tears as the words of James 2:5 pounded through my mind:  Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs to the Kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?

Surely this congregation ministered to me more than I did to them.  Perhaps the day will come that Haiti will be sending missionaries to America.",198
16,2297,"My only trip to Hesse (so far) was a long layover at the Frankfurt airport while changing planes, traveling from Helsinki, Finland, back to the Atlanta airport in the United States.  It was the last leg of a two week trip to the old Soviet Union.  I was frustrated to be in Frankfurt for three hours but not to be able to see anything except the airport and the area right around it. I walked almost nonstop during that time to see as much as possible. This is one of only a couple of places on my MTP list in which I only saw the airport and environs.",809
17,2297,"My only visit to Sonora, Mexico (so far) was a day trip into Nogales, Sonora, Mexico From Nogales, Arizona, U.S.A. in December of 2004.  I was with my wife Karen, mother-in-law and step-daughter, Jennifer, during the Christmas holidays.

Crossing the border from Nogales, Arizona, to Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, was a cinch. Although we passed through a revolving gate, there was no one there to check us in. We weren\\\'t asked for passports or any type of identification whatsoever - we just walked in. However, it is my understanding that there is a border station a short distance outside of town for those who venture further into the interior.

No visa is required for visits of 72 hours or less. You may drive your vehicle into Mexico, but insurance is required and most American policies don\\\'t cover you there. Insurance offices are near the border for those who need to get it. For most people visiting Nogales from the USA, it is easier and more practical to park in one of the lots near the American side of the border and walk across.

Many Americans cross over the border to buy their medications because they are cheaper in Mexico. You won\\\'t have to look hard to find a pharmacy; there are dozens of them - everywhere you look in Nogales. As we were walking down the main shopping street in town we were actually accosted several times by people inviting us into their pharmacy.

Not only are prices cheaper here, but some drugs which require a prescription in the United States, such as antibiotics, can be obtained without a prescription in Mexico. This is all perfectly legal, but there are some restrictions. I would strongly advise anyone planning to take drugs of any kind back over the border to be aware of both American and Mexican laws concerning them beforehand. 

As far as illegal drugs go, Both the U.S.A. and Mexico have no tolerance at all. This is no place to test the law; don\\\'t even think about it.

You will see a few places in Nogales where you can change your Dollars for Pesos, but unless you are going further into the interior of Mexico I would advise you not to bother. The shops and restaurants in Nogales all take American money. In fact, they seem to prefer it. Virtually everywhere we looked prices were posted in dollars instead of pesos.

We had lunch at the El Greco Restaurant which, according to my mother-in-law o was living in Tucson at the time, is one of the finer restaurants in Nogales. It is on the second story above several shops, and in one of them we were offered a coupon for a free margarita with our lunch at El Greco, so we accepted the offer.

The dining room is tastefully decorated with linen tablecloths and big windows overlooking the street. There was an organist - a very good one too - who provided live music of both American and Mexican oldies which added much to the ambience. The servers were all men in white shirts and ties and the service was excellent. 

During our lunch we were solicited three times: by a man who wanted to take our photo, another who wanted to draw our caricature and a mariachi with a guitar who wanted to sing us a song. We opted for the singer, and he did a fine job.

The Margaritas were not huge, but larger than we expected for free. The alcohol content seemed a little low, which was fine with me since I never did like the taste of the stuff. 

I had the \\\""Lunch Special,\\\"" a Mexican combination platter. It was good, but neither as good nor as generous a serving as is the Mexican platter at El Rancho Grande - where we lived at the time in Ohio. And the price of $7.75 US was more than our amigos in Ohio charge for lunch. But then in Ohio they don\\\'t have linen tablecloths.

One of the primary reasons Americans come to Nogales is to shop, and one of the most colorful places to pick up a bargain is from the scores of street vendors who set up along the two blocks of Pasaje Morelos. This is a repainted alleyway which has been converted into an open-air pedestrian shopping strip. Even if you are \\\""just looking\\\"", you will find Pasaje Moreles an interesting walk, although you may also find it to be a bit crowded.

There are also many finer shops throughout the city for those who are seeking something a little nicer.

On at least half a dozen street corners in Nogales we saw entrepreneurs set up with burros or donkeys and colorful props and backdrops, soliciting tourists to have their picture taken.

Sure, it\\\'s touristy, but why not just do it? We were asked $5.00 to take this picture of Karen on a burro, but the man readily accepted $2.00 when I made the counter-offer. He helped Karen mount and eagerly outfitted her with a sombrero, a tequila bottle, and a colorful shawl. It was a fun thing to do, we made a happy memory, and our amigo made a couple of dollars - a good deal all the way around.",669

20,2297,"I only visited the island nation of Barbados for about four hours.  I had booked a flight on Liat Airlines from Grenada, where I had spend a four days, to Isla Margarita, in Venezuela, by way of Caracas. My flight schedule called for a four hour layover in Barbados.  Determined not to sit in the airport for four hours, and delighted with the chance to get a brief glimpse of Barbados, I passed through customs and immigration. 

Hailing a taxi outside the airport, I inquired of a suitable place to spend my time.  The taxi driver suggested a beachfront hotel just a few miles away from the airport, so that\'s where I went.  The drive allowed me to drink in a sampling of the countryside.  I saw no towns, but did have a view of numerous small farms, many children playing, people working or walking along and goats grazing in the fields. I stayed as long as I dared without risking missing my flight to Venezuela.  That was time enough to explore the resort, take a long walk along the beach, and then chill out for a while in a beach chair with my toes digging into the sand.  Next time I hope my stay in Barbados will be much longer.",184

26,2297,"I have visited the Dry Tortugas on two different occasions.  The first time was in the winter of 1976.  I flew from what was  then my home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Miami, Florida, on business.  Having always been intrigued by maps of the Florida Keys, I decided to stay over a few extra days and visit them.  In Marathon Key I found a company which offered seaplane trips to the Dry Tortugas, then known as the Fort Jefferson National Monument.  I bought a ticket and was excited about taking my first seaplane ride.  A half dozen other passengers were on the same trip, but because I was the only one who was traveling solo it was my good fortune to sit in the copilots seat.  The pilot offered me earphones so I could hear him as we went.  
We flew at a very low altitude all the way, and the pilot pointed out points of interest, such as small uninhabited islands, shipwrecks, and even an occasional shark.  Before we landed he banked the plane to give me a good aerial shot of the island.  We stayed about three hours, which was plenty of time to thoroughly explore Fort Jefferson.  Even though the fort was never completely finished, it is still the largest masonry structure in the Americas.  New implements of war, developed during Abraham Lincoln’s War to Prevent Southern Independence, made the fort obsolete before it was finished.
I was especially interested to see the cell which housed Dr. Samuel Alexander Mudd, who was charged with conspiring to assassinate United States President Abraham Lincoln.  Dr. Mudd had treated the broken ankle of John Wilkes Booth, after he injured himself by jumping from the Balcony of Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., after he shot the president.  Mudd was later pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, who rose to the office following the death of Lincoln.

My second visit to the Dry Tortugas was even more fun than the first.  It was during Spring Break, 1995, and I was camping in the keys with my family.  One day I took my son Jeremy to the Dry Tortugas by seaplane out of Key West.  This time we carried our snorkeling gear with which we swam all the way around the back of the fort – an awesome experience we will always remember.  
By the way, the Dry Tortugas gets its name because the sandy islands, 67 miles west of Key West, are dry.  They have no source of fresh water.  Tortugas is Spanish for Turtle, and the turquoise waters surrounding the islands are the haunt of an abundance of sea turtles.  Many water birds can also be seen there.",782

28,2297,"Ontario was the first Canadian province I visited, and that was on a trip to Niagara Falls when I was nineteen.  Numerous visits have followed, including a low budget trip by bus from Cincinnati, Ohio to Toronto, where I stayed four days and three nights in a downtown hostel.  Twice I have taken road trips across Ontario on the Trans-Canada Highway traveling both east and west. I have also made overnight trips to Windsor and environs on two occasions, where I have visited with friends who live there.  Being a lover of the outdoors and wild places, I especially have enjoyed my trips to Northern Ontario, where I have seen moose, black bear, loon, and other wildlife and have also hiked to remote lakes, waterfalls, and other scenic vistas.


My most recent visit to Ontario was a five day road trip with my wife, Karen, to the Bruce Peninsula National Park and the Fantom Five National Marine Park, in Bruce County.",130
29,2297,"I have been privileged to visit the island nation of Antigua on two occasions.  The first time, in February, 1989, I arrived by air from St. Maarten.  I was on a month long solo trip to the Caribbean on a 30 day ticket which was a special promotion offered by Liat Airlines at that time.  I began my trip in the U.S. Virgin Islands and ended it a month later in Caracas, Venezuela, visiting and exploring a total of 11 places along the way.  This was a low budget trip in which I stayed no resorts, but in the most inexpensive accommodations I could find.  In Antigua, that was in a spare bedroom of  a private home in the capital city of St. Johns.
      
My second visit to Antigua was in November, 2001, and I arrived by sea aboard the MV/Amazing Grace which was a converted British Navy Lighthouse Tender which was later put to use as the supply ship for the now defunct Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, a small fleet of sailing ships.  We stopped for the day at English Harbour, on the opposite end of the island from my previous visit.  This gave me the opportunity to see parts of Antigua I had missed before.  I especially enjoyed exploring Nelson\\\'s Dockyard National Park. The dockyard was developed as a base for the British Navy in the days of the great sailing ships.  The picturesque natural harbour served as the headquarters of the fleet of the Leeward Islands during the turbulent years of the late 18th century.",180
30,2297,"My first visit to New York State was  in August, 1964, when I was a 19 years old.  To get there I had hitched a ride with some friends from my home in  Cleveland, Tennessee, to their home in Erie, Pennsylvania.  I stayed with them for a week before taking the bus back home.  On my last day in Pennsylvania, we took a day trip to Niagara Falls – my first time in both New York and Ontario, Canada.
The next visit I made to New York was on foot – literally, hiking solo along the Appalachian Trail.  On that particular trip, in the summer of 1975, I had started from the Delaware Water Gap on the Pennsylvania/New Jersey border and walked across New Jersey in three days, into New York.  That same summer I also visited New York City while doing research on a book I was writing.
There have been numerous trips to and through every part of New York.  On one of those trips I hiked an icy 15 mile trail which took me to the top of Mt. Marcy, which at an elevation of  5344’ is the highest point in the state.  On a more recent trip to New York I walked from Manhattan to Brooklyn on the famous Brooklyn Bridge, June 6, 2011, thus completing my visits to every one  of the 62 counties in the state of.  
Each of the 5 Boroughs of New York City is a separate county.  Brooklyn, which is Kings County, brought my total to 3,066 visited of the 3,142 counties, parishes, independent cities, Alaskan boroughs and census areas in the United States.  It would take me another two years to complete entire United States.",121

32,2297,"South Dakota has always held a very special place in my heart.  Maybe it is because I spent several weeks traveling about that state on a three month solo trip to the western United States when I was twenty.  It was my first time to be on an extended trip on my own.  I have returned to the state numerous times since then and have always found new and exciting places to explore.

Most of South Dakota\'s major tourist destinations can be found in the Black Hills, in the southwestern corner of the state.  Well known attractions include the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Badlands National Park, Jewell Cave, Wind Cave, and the amazing Custer State Park, with abundant wildlife, including the largest free roaming bison herd in the world.  The wide open spaces and small rural towns which cover most of the state also hold many fascinating spots which reveal their presence, and their secrets, only to those who slow down and take the time to explore this beautiful state, which just happens to contain the center point for the United States of America.  

In September of 2009, I had time to take a two week vacation but my wife only had one week off.  No problem; I took a leisurely drive from our home which was then in Ohio, to Rapid City, South Dakota, where I picked my wife up at the airport.  Karen and I enjoyed a wonderful week exploring the Black Hills area, then she flew back home alone.  I took another zigzag route back home, collecting new counties along the way.  It was on that trip that I completed my visits to each of South Dakota\'s 66 counties.",141

He replied that he would like to take a trip to Vermont, so we flew to Burlington, VT and rented a car and a condo in Stowe for a week.  Every day we took day trips to explore Vermont, and one day we ventured into New Hampshire and Maine, my 49th and 50th states to collect.  

Since then I have returned to New Hampshire at least three times.  and have made it a point to visit each of the ten counties in the state.  I have enjoyed exploring the state capitol in Concord, and numerous other small towns, some with quaint covered bridges, old mills, and other points of interest as well as historic sites.  Most of all I have enjoyed exploring and hiking in New Hampshire\\\'s White Mountains, and especially the exhilarating drive to the summit of Mount Washington, which at 6,288 ft. is the highest point in the northeastern United States.  There my son and I were caught in an unexpected snow squall in July. It turned out to be a great adventure since the snow didn\'t last long.",118
36,2297,"In the early spring of 1985, I spent two weeks exploring the Holy Land with a study tour led by the Jerusalem Center for Biblical Studies.  We began  with a couple of days in Jordan, spent about a week in Israel, and then traveled on for a few days in Egypt. The Journey from Jerusalem to Egypt was on a tour bus, through the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.  At that time there was no travel allowed between Israel and Egypt except for organized tour groups.

Our drive through the Sinai was uneventful and there was little to see except desert scenery, a few Bedouins, and glimpses of the Mediterranean Sea, sometimes fringed with date palms. I could not help but think Moses and the children of Israel traveling through this stark landscape so long ago.

We made only a single stop in the Sinai, probably around Arish.  It was a desperately needed stop since I seemed to be coming down with a case of traveler\'s diarrhea.  In my urgent condition, I happened to be the last one in line to use the facilities, and was almost left behind by the bus which I saw pulling out as I left the men\'s room.  I had to run, waving my arms and yelling until they stopped and let me on board.

Crossing over the Suez Canal was very interesting.  We were not allowed off the bus at the canal, although we endured a long stop while great ships and freighters passed through.  From our vantage point we could not see the water in the canal and the ships seemed to be gliding on the desert sand which, with the intense sun, created a mirage on the desert.",745
37,2297,"In the early spring of 1985 I entered and crossed the Gaza Strip by bus.  The adventure began when I signed up for a two week Holy Land pilgrimage to Jordan, Israel, and Jordan.  The first leg of the trip was by air from Atlanta, Georgia to Amsterdam, Netherlands, and from their aboard KLM Airlines onward to Aaman, Jordan.  After spending the night in Amman, our group of about 40 boarded a tour bus to Jerusalem, Israel.  Jordan and Israel were technically at war with each other at the time, and there was no public transportation of any kind available between the two nations.  However, the two countries had agreed to allow tour groups of religious pilgrims to cross the border, after being thoroughly searched and questioned on each side of the border.  I suppose this was because both countries benefited from Our tourist dollars.

After several days in Jerusalem, it was time to travel onward to Cairo, Egypt.  The most shortest and most direct route was  right through the middle of the Gaza Strip, which was also at war with Israel - even more so than Jordan.  As we approached the heavily guarded Gaza border, our tour guide, took on a somber expression and instructed us that while traveling through Jordan we would not stop or get off of the bus for any reason.  He strongly cautioned us against doing anything to pay attention to ourselves and told us to be careful to not make any gestures in any way that could be seen through the windows.  To do so he said could cause the Palestinians to stop and attack the bus.  Because of his very serious demeanor in giving these instructions, all on board complied.  I did risk taking a couple of discrete photos out the bus window as we passed by along the Mediterranean coast.  If I every get around to converting those color slides into digital form, I will post them on this page.

Yes, I count that as a visit to the Gaza Strip.  Of course I would have preferred to have gotten off the bus and explored the place and met the people.  Still, I was definitely there.  During other portions of the same trip, our group travel a great deal in other parts of Palestine, going into the Golan Heights all the way up to the border with Lebanon and Syria, and also visiting several other points in Palestine such as Jerico, and Bethlehem, where I met and chatted with the Christian mayor of that city.",426

AMMAN, JORDAN: Arriving alone in Amman, Jordan in the spring of 1985 presented no problems. An immigration officer at the airport matter-of-factly gave me a 30-day visa.

Two days earlier in Istanbul (see previous post,) I had been separated from the tour group with which I was traveling to the Holy Land. My problem had been compounded by the fact that I was the only non-Methodist in a group comprised of Methodist ministers. I later learned that concluded I had used their group to get to Turkey, and that our unscheduled stop in that country had been part of some clandestine plan. They had gone ahead without me, giving it little more thought. When I arrived in Jordan, they had already left that country by bus and were somewhere in Israel.

It was evening when I landed in Amman. I checked into a hotel, expecting to buy a ticket the next morning for the two hour bus trip to Jerusalem. That morning a travel agent near the hotel gave me the distressing news. Israel and Jordan were officially at war with each other, and have been since the six day war of 1967. There is absolutely no public transportation between the two countries.

“A tour group is different,” the agent explained. “Both Jordan and Israel need the tourist dollars, so they have an agreement to allow foreign pilgrims to cross the border with a special visa. There is no way a person can make the journey alone.”

Back at my hotel I began calling in search of a tour group. Eureka! There was a bus load of Christian pilgrims eating a late breakfast at a hotel across the city. In less than an hour they were leaving for Israel.

I ran to catch a taxi. Arriving at the hotel restaurant which was full of Americans, I asked for the tour leader. To my delight he turned out to be Kash Amburgy, a Pentecostal preacher from Lebanon, Ohio. When I introduced myself he said he was an old acquaintance of my father.

Sitting in the back of the bus, traveling toward the Israeli border, I felt great. “God is so good,” I thought. I had an unexpected adventure in Istanbul, and now I’m safely on my way to Jerusalem.”

As we neared the border it was obvious we were in a war zone. There were soldiers, tanks, and bunkers at frequent intervals. About 100 years short of where the Allenby Bridge crosses the Jordan River into Israel, the bus came to a halt. Twenty soldiers armed with submachine guns surrounded us. Mr. Amburgy assured our group that this was just a routine stop.

One soldier boarded the bus and walked down the aisle checking passports. When he looked at mine his stoical expression suddenly changed. “You don’t belong on this bus,” he growled. “Come with me.”

A young couple with whom I had been talking became frantic. “Quick,” they insisted. “Give us your home telephone number. We’ll call your family and tell them where you are. I tossed them my card as the soldier yanked me off the bus.

The 20 soldiers outside gathered around me, much as those had done a couple of days earlier at the airport in Istanbul, except these seemed even more excited. Across the river Israeli artillery was pointed toward the Jordanians through bunkers and barbed wire. I prayed beneath my breath, “Lord, please get me over to that side of the river.”

From the stamp in my passport It was evident to the soldiers I had entered Jordan alone, from Turkey, and was not part of this group from Ohio. Under the hot desert sun they seemed to argue endlessly among themselves concerning how to handle the matter.

All of a sudden Mr. Amburgy, with holy boldness, cam e storming off the bus. With a red face and a loud commanding voice he waded into the circle of soldiers. “This boy’s with me; I know his daddy. He comes from a very important family back in America. Now you let him go!

To my utter amazement the officer who seemed to be in charge gave a disgusted grunt and motioned us both back onto the bus. We rolled over the Allenby Bridge, across the muddy Jordan, and into the Promised Land.",431

ISTANBUL, TURKEY: I was en-route to the Holy Land, in early spring, 1985, flying from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Amman Jordan, on a KLM Airlines 747. The captain’s voice came over the speaker, “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to make an unscheduled stop in Istanbul, Turkey. We’ll be on the ground for about one hour.” No explanation was give as to the purpose of the stop.

What great luck, I thought. That’s just long enough to say that I’ve been to Istanbul, ancient Constantinople.

Viewing the exotic Moslem city from the air made my pulse quicken. The skyline, with its numerous domed mosques looked like something out of a Rudyard Kipling novel. In the outlying fields shepherds herded their flocks.

The airport was heavily guarded. Armed soldiers stood on elevated platforms above the high fence which surrounded the runway. In my excitement I didn’t hear the announcement that all passengers were to remain on board. I’ll never know why I wasn’t stop as I walked off the plane.

The best souvenir I could imagine was not a trinket from an airport gift shop, but a stamp in my passport. Without any luggage, I walked through customs unhindered. At the immigration desk I presented my passport for the coveted stamp, and received it without a hitch.

Walking outside the airport, I took a deep breath and smiled to myself. “So this is the legendary Turkish capital.” I walked around the front of the airport to see as much as I could. Forty minutes of the allotted one hour passed. Just to be safe, I decided to re-board the plane.

That’s when two armed guards stopped me at the airport entrance. “Ticket,” they demanded. That seemed to be about the only word they knew in English. The other word was “No!” which they repeated with increasing vehemence as I tried vainly to explain to them my situation.

When I made an effort to enter the airport above their protest, they pressed the barrels of their submachine guns into my stomach.

I’ve never seen anyone prouder than these two young Turks as they marched me off to the police sub-station in the airport. I was taken into a bare room where one stood guard over me while the other went for assistance.

Soon I was surrounded by a dozen angry looking dark-faced men in uniform. One of them spoke English. He demanded my passport. With exaggerated motions he crossed out my immigration stamp, scribbling something beside it in Turkish. I glanced out the window just in time to see my flight taxiing onto the runway. My heart sank; the blood drained from my white face.

I was informed I had entered the country illegally. My ticket was from Atlanta to Amsterdam and from there to Amman. I didn’t have passage into our out of Turkey. The officer gravely shook his head, “This is very serious.”

For more than an hour I stood in the middle of the room, praying silently while the police argued among themselves in excited tones as to what to do with me. Through the interpreter I laboriously explained again and again how I had arrived in their country.

Finally they must have decided I wasn’t subversive – just stupid. The English-speaking officer turned to be with a wide grin which showed a missing front tooth. Returning my passport he said in a pronounced accent. “Velcome to Istanbul. You may go now.”

The first flight I was able to book to Amman was 26 hours later via Royal Jordanian Airlines. They were very kind to offer me free passage. Twenty-six hours gave me the opportunity for a fascinating day of exploration. A taxi took me to a hotel near the Bosporus Bridge, which connects Europe with Asia.

The next morning, while visiting the famed Blue Mosque, I met a local young man who was eager to practice his English. I accepted his invitation to have afternoon tea with his family. He treated me as an honored guest and proudly showed me off to his friends and neighbors. It was an experience I would not have wanted to have missed.

Little did I know that in only 48 hours, on a lonely Jordanian road, near the place where Moses looked over into the Promised Land, I would be arrested again.",325

There are only four other independent cities in the United States which are not in a county.  They are:  Baltimore, Maryland; Carson City, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri, and Washington, DC.   Also note that Virginia is not a state, but a commonwealth.   Three other constituent states of the United States of America use the nomenclature of commonwealth.  They are:  Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.
Virginia is very diverse in its landscape and its population, going from Atlantic  beaches to the Appalachian mountains, and from the coal mines in the southwest to the suburbs of Washington D.C. in the northeast.   My first memory of visiting Virginia was on a trip with my dad and brothers from the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee to Washington, via the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Shenandoah National Park.  Later, while in my twenties and early thirties I hiked hundreds of miles of the famed Appalachian Trail as it winds its way through Virginia, from Damascus, on the Tennessee border, to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, a short distance south of the Mason Dixon Line.  I’ve visited and driven through the Virginia commonwealth countless times between then and now.

I have been privileged to return to Idaho a half dozen times or more since then, and have spent time in each of Idaho\'s 44 counties.  Most of those trips were solo.  My latest visit to Idaho holds a special place in my memories.  It was in July, 2013, when I took my bride, Karen.  We took a long road trip from Cincinnati, Ohio to Yellowstone National Park.  After spending three days in Yellowstone, we ventured westward into Idaho, which was the culmination of Karen\'s goal to visit each of the 50 United States.",97
42,2297,"My first time to visit the state of Nevada was in the winter of 1967.  I was living in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the time and volunteered to drive a pickup truck pulling a trailer to Westwood, California to bring back a load of used clothing to be distributed among the Navaho Indians in Gallup, New Mexico.  On that trip I entered Nevada after sunset at Hoover Dam, on the Arizona border.   Since I did not have money for a motel room, I decided to just drive all night, first through the Las Vegas strip and then northwest toward Reno, where I would exit the state into California.  The sun was rising as I reached Walker Lake, Nevada, where I stopped to take pictures.
It was many years later before I returned to Nevada.  However, I have now been in the state at least a half dozen times now, visiting by plane, train, and automobile.  Nevada best known for the glitz, gambling, and sin of Las Vegas and Reno.  Although I have visited those cities, I have enjoyed exploring the vast emptiness of the state much more.  Especially fascinating are the Great Basin and Death Valley National Parks.

I was living in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at the time and was invited to speak at a district-wide banquet of church leaders in Laurel, Delaware. Driving down to that appointment took me through every county in the state - all three of them.  Delaware has fewer counties than any other state in the union, including smaller Rhode Island, which is divided into five counties.

On my most recent trip to Delaware, in June, 2011, I again visited every county, but my goal this time was somewhat different.  In researching my genealogy I had learned that my great, great uncle, John Thomas Conn, had been a prisoner of war at Fort Delaware during the War Between the States.  John Thomas was one of four brothers from Cobb County, Georgia, who had fought during that tragic conflict. John Thomas was lucky to have been captured.  He was the only one of the four Conn brothers who survived the war and returned home to Georgia.

Several weeks before before embarking on our cruise we did an internet search and found a young native couple living on Roatan who offered guided tours.  It turned out to be a great choice for us.  They met us at the dock and took us on a day long cruise which showed us far more than the shore excursions offered by the cruise lines, for less money, and with a very personable guide who turned out to have formerly worked on a cruise ship.  

We circled the island, making several stops at various points of interest.  At one point we left the car and took a small boat along the shore and into a couple of beautiful coves, and then through a mangrove forest.  At our request, our guide took us to a native restaurant on the far side of the island, one that is not normally frequented by people on cruises.  There we enjoyed an exceptionally fine meal of fried fish and plantains with a beautiful waterfront view. I got a kick out of the fact that when I asked where the restroom was, I was told to dip a bucket of water from the rain barrel and take it with me to use to wash my hands and flush the toilet after I had finished.  It was a wonderful visit to a beautiful island with very friendly local people - special trip to remember always.",791

My favorite parts of the state can be found in the national parks and monuments:  Rock Mountain, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Dinosaur, Mesa Verde, Great Sand Dunes, and Colorado, Hovenweep, Curecanti, and Bent’s Old Fort.   However, if one should not visit a single one of these sites, there are still numerous scenic wonders that are just as interesting to see.  My proudest adventure in the state was a solo ascent to the top of Mt. Elbert, which at 14,440 feet above sea level is the highest summit in the state.   If you’re not up to that strenuous of a climb, you can get almost as high by taking the drive up Pike’s Peak or Mt. Evans, the highest paved road in North America, at more than 14,000 feet.",91
49,2297,"When I was just a kid, traveling with my dad and brothers, I clearly remember stopping at a motel in Meridian, Mississippi.  We were en route from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Roswell, New Mexico.  That Mississippi stop stands out in my memory because there we were amazed to bump into good friends of ours, the Vep Ellis family, who lived near us hundreds of miles away in in East Tennessee.    That was the first of countless “small world” encounters I have had during a lifetime of travel.  
I’ve visited Mississippi numerous times since then and in the process have managed to visit each of the 82 counties in the Magnolia State.  Looking through my photos of Mississippi for this post, I noticed that most of those trips to and through Mississippi have been in winter.  No doubt that is because the weather here can be very hot and humid in summer and is generally more pleasant in winter, although the state does infrequently experience snow and ice storms.
Favorite memories of Mississippi include a hike up Woodall Mountain, the highest point in the state; camping in Desoto National Forest; exploring Vicksburg National Battlefield and several other sites from the War Between the States;   swinging on the porch of the house where Elvis Presley was born in Tupelo; fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, from a pier in Gulfport; enjoying a leisurely three day drive with Karen up the beautiful and historic Natchez Trace Parkway, and much more.",112
50,2297,"My first visit to British Columbia was on October 3 and 4 2008.  On that trip I had to drive through a several miles in southern British Columbia in order to reach Point Roberts, Washington, on my quest to visit each of the 3,142 counties and county equivalents in the United States. Point Roberts is a seldom visited geographic oddity, a small tip of land which is in the state of Washington, but can only be reached by land by going through about 30 miles or so in British Columbia, then dipping back south into this isolated spot in the United States.  I spent one night in motel in Delta, BC. Although I was within easy striking distance of the city of Vancouver on that solo trip, and wanted to go there, I decided to wait and experience Vancouver for the first time with my wife on a trip we were planning.

Karen and I made it to Vancouver in May, 2009 and spent three days and two nights exploring that beautiful city before embarking on a cruise from Vancouver to Seward, Alaska, via the Inside Passageway.",88
51,2297,"in April, 2008, I took a solo bus trip through Central America, beginning in Guatemala and traveling south through El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and return.  I spent from two to seven nights each in all of the countries except Honduras, which I traveled through on the Pan American Highway twice, going north and south.  Tica Bus, which I rode on the main segment of the trip, made only a single stop in Honduras, and that was at a convenience store/gas station, to refuel the bus and give the passengers a rest stop.  This was my second time to be in Honduras since I had previously visited the Bay Islands of the Caribbean coast.  It was good to at least get a small glimpse of the mainland.",159

54,2297,"In April, 2002, my new bride, Karen, and I flew from Cincinnati, Ohio to London, England, to embark on a two week honeymoon around Great Britain.  We chose to rent a car and in a way I was amazed that the rental agency didn\'t even ask me if I knew how to drive on the left side of the street.  Actually, my only experience in doing so before  had been in Trinidad and Tobago several years earlier.  

We drove first to Cambridge, where we visited my cousin, Alan Wheeler, who was a student at Cambridge University at the time.  It was a great place to sleep off our jet lag, and then have a \""local\"" show us around for a couple of days.  A highlight was punting on the Cam.  I never knew until then that Cambridge was named for the bridge which crosses the Cam River there.

We chose not to make advance reservations for lodging, and were fortunate to be able to find reasonable rooms wherever we went.  We had overnight visits to York and Bath, especially enjoying the historical sites in those cities.  We then ventured north into Scotland, then on to Wales where we stayed in a medieval castle, but I will say more about those on the appropriate pages.  

A side trip to Stonehenge was a must see on our bucket list.  Then It was back to London to take in the sights of that City we had missed earlier.  It happened to be the same time as the queen mum\'s funeral, and also the London Marathon, so London was crowded with visitors.  Of the many sights we saw (Big Ben, Westminster Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, and much more), I was especially determined to see the Tower of London.  As fate would have it, we found ourselves standing on a  corner across from the Tower, and the street was blocked by the Marathon which was in progress.  We watched for an opening between the runners for several minutes, then finally made our dash across the closed street.  As we did, a policeman yelled at us to go back, saying \""These people have waiting all year for this race, you\'ll have to come back tomorrow.\""  I grabbed my wife\'s hand and kept running while I yelled back, \""I\'ve waited 54 years to see the Tower of London, and today is my only chance.\""  I don\'t know what the onlookers thought of us rude Americans, but we loved our visit to their awesome city.",260

56,2297,"I visited Egypt in February of 2085 as part of a two week tour with the Jerusalem Center for Biblical Studies.  I was the only non-Methodist in a group of pastors who were gaining college credit for the tour with lectures in Jordan, Israel, and Egypt.  We flew from the United States to Amman, Jordan via KLM Airways.  Travel from Amman to Jerusalem and then from Jerusalem to Cairo was by charter tour bus.  From Jerusalem we passed through the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and across the Suez Canal.  I am not sure such a trip by bus would be possible by bus today, but then all three countries seemed to allow charter busses of pilgrims to make the journey.  Apparently, all the countries benefited from the revenue the trip generated.  At that time there was no public bus transportation allowed between Jordan, Israel and Egypt. 

We spent the final three days of the trip in Cairo, staying at the Holiday Inn near the great pyramids of Giza.  I have more photos to post if I ever get time to transfer them from color slides to a digital format.",372
57,2297,"I visited the Caribbean island nation of Anguilla for three days and two nights, February 13-15, 1989. Travel to Anguilla was by a short ferry ride from nearby St. Martin, and departure was via Liat airlines, first back to Sint Maarten, then onward to Dominica.  This was one leg in a 30 day tour to 11 Caribbean nations, from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Isla Margarita in Venezuela.

I arrived in Anguilla without a reservation, hailed a taxi at the docks, and asked the driver if he would recommend an inexpensive place to stay.  He took me to Lloyd\'s Guest House and Beach Apartments, located on Crocus Hill and a short walk from the very beautiful Crocus Bay.  Price for the room included meals, served family style around a big table.  One of the most enjoyable factors in my stay in Anguilla was chatting around the table with the eclectic assortment of other guests who were from various places around the world.

During my three days on Anguilla, I enjoyed hanging out some at an open air café on Crocus Bay, and also spent several hours walking about the island, immersing myself in the rural ambiance of the island which appeared to have very little tourist infrastructure at the time.",179
58,2297,"Georgia is the largest state of the United States, in land area, east of the Mississippi River.  It is subdivided into 159 counties, which is more than any other state except Texas.  Geographically it has much to offer, from the sea islands along the Atlantic Coast to Appalachian mountain peaks which rival those in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  Springer Mountain, Georgia, is the southern terminus of the famed Appalachian Trail, the world\\\\\\\'s longest marked footpath, which finds its northern terminus at Mt. Kathadin, Maine, more than 2,000 miles to the north.

People in Georgia often refer to the two Georgias.  One is Metropolitan Atlanta, and the other is the rest of the state.  Atlanta, a world class metropolis, boasts the busiest airport in the world and is the home of Coca Cola, CNN Television, and numerous other international corporations.  The other Georgia has impressive smaller cities such as Columbus, Macon, Savannah, and Augusta, home of the famous Masters Golf Tournament.  I lived in Augusta for 15 years, from 1777-1992 and fell in love with the state.  My favorite places are the small towns and back roads with delightful surprises at almost every turn, including battlefields from the War Between the States, and the Okefenokee Swamp, the largest blackwater swamp in North America and one of the five largest swamps in the world. Atlanta is a vastly different world than the rest of the state, which I call the real Georgia.",96
59,2297,"My wife Karen and I visited the island of Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles, also called the Caribbean Netherlands, on March 18, 2010.  We were on a cruise aboard Royal Caribbean\\\\\\\'s Enchantment of the Seas.  We were totally captivated by this colorful island and were amazed to note how each of the neighboring ABC Islands, Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, have their own distinct character and appeal. Of special interest was the row of colorful waterfront buildings which provides an iconic travel photo opportunity at Willemstad, the capital and largest city of the island.  Not to be missed in Willemstad is the preserved historic RIF Fort, established in 1828.

 We also took a tour around the island and found the interior equally fascinating for it\\\\\\\'s history, beaches, and quaint countryside  there were everal points of interest, including a natural arch, salt flats, and the beautiful beach at Playa Kenepa Grandi.  We also took a short but interesting hike at Shete Boka National Park, where we saw a churning rocky coast, numerous tropical birds, and lots of iguanas.",189

Ruthin Castle is a little more pricey than the places we usually stay, but we made the splurge since it was our honeymoon and it it was worth every penny. We will cherish the memories we made there for the rest of our lives.

This is an authentic mediaeval castle, the oldest remains of which date back to 1277. A short walk from the quaint town centre, it is surrounded by thirty acres of gardens with flowers and peacocks and a flock of sheep. We loved exploring the old walls, dungeons, and passageways. We also kept watch for the resident ghost, the Lady in Gray, but she failed to make an appearance during our visit. evening.",328
62,2297,"I visited the United Nations Headquarters in New York, NY, on June 16, 2011.  It was a beautiful sunny day when I drove into the city by way of Staten Island after spending the previous night in New Jersey.  Parking at the Staten Island Ferry, I rode across New York Harbor to Manhattan, enjoying the excellent views of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty.

First item on my agenda that day was to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, a long time goal.  With some difficulty I found the entrance to the bridge, after having been given poor directions by at least six different people, including two policemen.  When I finally crossed the Brooklyn Bridge it was an exhilarating experience because it marked my entrance into not only my 62nd and last county to visit in New York State, but also my final county to collect east of the Rocky Mountains.  This was all part of a 17 year quest to visit each of the 3,142 counties, or county equivalents, in the United States, a quest which I completed in September, 2012.

After walking about Brooklyn for a couple of hours and enjoying lunch there, I then walked back into Manhattan via the Manhattan Bridge.  From there I headed north toward the United Nations Headquarters.  Unfortunately, I was not wearing proper walking shoes, and had underestimated the distance.  With my feet getting sore and my energy dwindling, I caught a cab for the last couple of miles to the United Nations Headquarters.

I explored all of the public areas of the U.N. complex, then got myself a cold soft drink, found a place to sit for a spell and watched the interesting parade of people of all nationalities who were entering and exiting the building.  Satisfied that I had seen all that a person who has no real business there could see, I caught a bus back to the Staten Island Ferry and headed home.",144

Highlights were Lake Goto Mere with it\'s numerous pink flamingos, and the Washington Slagbaai National Park. Coming back to Kralendijk, we still had time to take an unguided walking tour of the city, with its quaint colorful buildings, Government House, Customs House, historic Fort Oranje, and other interesting sites. The beauty and history of this tropical island made it a very pleasant and memorable visit.",186
64,2297,"My first visit to Wyoming was in the summer of 1964, when I was 19 years old.  I drove with five college friends from Tennessee to Dillon, Montana, where we spent the summer.  Along the way, we crossed Wyoming twice, visiting Devil\'s Tower National Monument and Yellowstone National Park, both in Wyoming. 

I fell in love with the wide open spaces, scenic splendor and abundant wildlife of this magnificent state.the least populated in the United States.  In September of 1966 I moved to Casper, Wyoming and lived there for about one year, to take advantage of a job opportunity in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

I have returned to Wyoming on numerous occasions during which I have explored each of the 18 counties in the Cowboy State.  On one trip, with three of my brothers, we backpacked for four days deep into the Wind River Range.  Our goal was to climb Gannet Peak, the highest mountain in the state, but we turned back before reaching the top because of a summer snowstorm.  We camped for three days at an elevation of more than 12,000 feet at the base of the mountain, but felt conditions were too dangerous to continue on. Spring, summer and fall are generally fabulous in Wyoming.  Winters can be bitterly cold and the wind seems to never stop blowing.

67,2297,"I first visited the Mexican state of Coahuila in September, 2005, on a day trip to Piedras Negras, a city of about 200,000 people at the northern border with Texas, on the Rio Grande River.  Piedras is sister city to Eagle Pass, Texas, and it is 441 km north of Saltillo, capital city of Coahuila, via Federal Highway 57.  The area surrounding Piedras Negras is ranchland, and also a popular area for hunting wild game.

Piedras Negras is known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\""La Puerta de Mexico\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"" (Mexico\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Door), however I found it to be much less touristy than other border towns I have been to, and a visit there seems much more authentically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\""Mexican.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"" Piedras Negras is the home of the Nacho, a classic Tex-Mex dish of cheeze and tortilla chips.

69,2297,"The first time I traveled outside the United States was when I was 15, on a trip to the Bahamas.  My dad was going there for a church convention and invited me and two of my brothers to go along, but we had to pay our own way.  For the three day trip, passage aboard the S.S. Bahama Star was $99.  I had a college savings account from money I earned on my paper route, since I was ten, so I dipped into my college fund to pay for the trip.  This was before the days of the modern cruise ship industry.  Our boat was a passenger ship which had previously made transatlantic crossings, carrying more than 500 passengers.  It had just been refurbished and re-christened for the Bahamas route, this being the maiden voyage.  

The four of us, Dad, Philip, Paul and I, drove from our home in Cleveland, Tennessee to Miami Florida and spent the night the highest I had ever been in a hotel.  That night, which was New Year\\\\\\\'s Eve, just happened to be the evening of the famous Orange Bowl Parade, which went right in front of our hotel.  I had never been in a crowd that big and it was about as much excitement as a small town boy from Appalachia could contain.

On New Year\\\\\\\'s day we sailed for Nassau.  The ship docked at the pier there for three days and served as our hotel. At that time the Bahama Islands were still under British rule. While Dad was in his meetings, he allowed us boys to explore Nassau on our own.  We rented bicycles and rode them over much of the island.

The most exciting part of the voyage was when the ships broiler exploded on the return trip to the United States.  Paul and I had set our alarm clock for thirty minutes before daylight.  We wanted to see the sun rose over the Atlantic.  As we were getting dressed the lights suddenly went out in our cabin.  Emergency lights came on in the hallway ways and porters ran frantically through the ship, banging on every door and shouting:  The ship\\\\\\\'s on fire.  Put on your life jackets.  Everyone to the lifeboats.

Panic ensued.  Pajama clad people with wild eyes and messy hair were rushing to the top deck, fumbling with their life jackets as they went.  Some were weeping; others carried frightened children.  After considerable commotion for about 20 minutes it was announced that the fire had been extinguished and the ship was not in danger of sinking.  However, we had no power and were adrift.  The Gulf Stream was carrying us northward.

It took 12 hours for a couple of tug boats to catch up with us, many miles off course.  It took them another 12 hours or so to tow us back to Miami.  During that long day the kitchen was not in operation because of the lack of power. Also, most of the food supplies were exhausted, however some snacks were served.  

A few people kept their life jackets on and stayed near the life boats all day long.  Most of the passengers relaxed and made the best of an unexpected day at sea. During the afternoon I fished off the back of the boat with tackle and bait given me by some of the crew.  I didn\\\\\\\'t catch anything, but saw lots of flying fish.  It was one of the most fun days I had ever had. 

I have been back to The Bahamas twice since then.  One trip was a four day cruise on the Oceanic, aka. the Big Red Boat, with Premier Cruise Line.  The other time I flew to Freeport, where I caught a Windjammer supply ship which dropped me of in Trinidad two weeks later.  Both of those trips were lots of fun, but neither came up the excitement of the maiden voyage of the S.S. Bahama Star.",183

Would there be lavish examples of wealth that would make the average visitor feel alienated? Would it be too expensive to even make a day trip? The reality that I found was that Monaco was a very charming country filled with polite people (who were even more polite when spoken to in French.) The first day that my girlfriend and I went to the country, we took a SNCF train from Nice, which was a pleasant enough ride. Once there, we walked down a very nicely maintained street until we got to the Casino de Monte Carlo. The casino was well worth the 10 euro entrance fee even if one wasn't wanting to gamble simply for the exquisite Belle Epoque interior. Being there truly felt like being back in time due to the dark wood furniture and the abundance of suits as the night wore on. We eventually won a fair sum, so after ogling at the Rolls Royces and Bentleys outside, we went to a delightful restaurant in La Condamine called Quai des Artistes. Their seafood was delicious and the service was great. It really was a special treat to be at such a fancy restaurant dressed to the nines, and in such a historical country that many people never get to visit. The only problem was that Monaco doesn't have any trains after 11:30pm, and the night bus only runs three days a week. That meant that we were stuck taking a taxi back to France, but c'est la vie.
The next day, we took a train in the morning and got to see the country by daylight. It was quite the sight! The multilevel streets were quaint and completely litter free, yet crowded with buildings, and there were some occasional breathtaking sights thanks to the local topography. While visiting the Greek-inspired Sainte Dévoté Chapel, we were amused to see a group of American tourists posing for scavenger hunt pictures in front of the church by throwing tree branches into the air and jumping. We were tempted to find out more about their hunt, but unfortunately daylight was not on our side, so we had to catch our train to Italy.
On our way back from Ventimiglia that night, we decided to hop off the train in Monaco one last time so that we could take photos of the casinos with our dslr cameras. At least, that was the excuse. Really, we just wanted to be back even for another hour.

In Novi Sad, I visited the City Hall, Liberty Square, and the Petrovaradin Fortress – one of the largest and best preserved fortifications on the Danube River. Next I continued to Sremski Karlovci and visited the Patriarchal Residence and the St Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral before arriving at the Hopovo Monastery – one of the best preserved and most beautiful fresco-painted medieval monasteries in Europe and built within a walled fortress with active monks living on the premise. I then visited Niš via a stop at the Viminacium Archaeological Park, which was one of the most important Roman towns and military encampments from the period from the 1st to the 6th century, and the Golubac Fortress, one of the best preserved medieval fortresses in Europe and overlooks Romania. In Niš, I toured the 18th century Niš Fortress that was built by the Turks, and Skull Tower, which is composed largely of human skulls collected during the 1809 Battle of &#268;egar.

Next I headed to Tirana via a stop in Krujë to visit the castle and bazaar.

Next I continued on to Millersburg, in the center of Holmes County, which has the highest density of Amish in the country. Driving the two lane backroads throughout the county, which had bright green fields and mountains of dying cornstalks, was a real highlight of the trip as I saw dozens of Amish families walking around the roads and riding in traditional horse buggies.  I also visited Cuyahoga Valley NP, which was the least impressive national park I have visited (http://www.nps.gov/cuva/index.htm) and ended the trip in Cleveland where, among other places, I visited the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum (http://www.rockhall.com/) and the original home featured prominently in the 1983 classic film, A Christmas Story.",128

After nearly 43 hours of sailing, we stopped first at the barren and bird-filled volcanic rock of L esprance, the southernmost island of the Kermadecs, which we circumnavigated by ship before continuing on to the closely-linked Curtis Island and Cheeseman Island (where we did the same). Early on the fourth day of the expedition, we dropped anchor at Raoul Island, the largest island of the chain and the focus of our expedition, where we took zodiacs to the island and I made four separate several hour landings (1 landing each day) in which I hiked along various different trails. Highlights of Raoul Island were Denham Bay, with its beautiful beach coastline complete with a rusted shipwreck (and disembarking the island by zodiac with large waves which thoroughly soaked us all), the rugged island trails filled with friendly Kermadec perikeets (which numbered in the hundreds and were seen at very close range), and snorkeling twice offshore by zodiac with colorful fish and a few Galapagos sharks. After 4 days at Raoul Island, we spent 3 days sailing back to the Port of Tauranga, circumnavigating Macauley Island by ship on our voyage back, which completed our visit to all the main islands of the Kermadecs.  The lead staff of Heritage Expeditions noted that this expedition was the first time they had ever been able to make landings all four days at Raoul Island due to perfect weather conditions -- normally they schedule four days at Raoul and are only allowed to make two zodiac landings due to ocean swells which prevent safe landings on the rock-filled shoreline.",25

December 2014: I visited the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge (http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ridgefield/), located an easy 27-mile drive from Portland International Airport. The wildlife driving loop of the park is 4.2 miles throughout fields, wetlands, sloughs, and forests where it is very easy to spot at close range hundreds of Dusky Canada geese, Canadian sandhill cranes, various eagles, hawks and ducks, and dozens of nutrias -- which are a semi-aquatic rodent native to southern parts of South America. In the 1930s, they were sold throughout North America to fur farmers and as a means of controlling unwanted aquatic vegetation and many escaped and bread and now continue to live wild throughout southern Washington and Oregon.

Downtown Spokane reminded me a lot of downtown Minneapolis -- clean, compact, and with many sky-bridges connecting adjoining buildings.  I later visited the pleasant town of Walla Walla, which is known for its 100+ vineyards and the Washington State Penitentiary, which houses the worst criminals in Washington state and still gives death row inmates a choice of death -- lethal injection or hanging.

We all took a quick swim in the warm ocean off the makeshift landing dock before we returned to our boat and spent another 30+ hours in choppy ocean sailing back to Tarawa.

The first night I was their I fell asleep at dinner and my dad and his friends made a food monster with rice, lobster claws, and a chick head and took pictures of it with me sleeping. I enjoyed out door markets. One of coolest things that happened when I was there was when this street vendor trying to sell us watches took us up into this building into a purses shop. The vendor then knocked on one of the purse shelf walls and it opened up and we went into a secret room and and it was full of thousands of knock off watches. I spent about 5 nights in Shanghai.",678

There are several neat tricks on the equator, along with the water reversing directions thing. Balanced an egg on a nail, and lost balance trying to walk along the line.",168

The people of Ireland truly know how to make a person feel welcome.  <br><br>Being a city girl at heart, Dublin was my favorite spot.  I stayed at The Westin hotel on College Street the first 3 days and at The Shelbourne Hotel the last 2 days of my trip.  The days in between I visited Galway and Killarney.  <br><br>Galway was ground zero for taking a tour into the Burren with a stop at the Cliffs of Moher.  <br><br>I then grabbed a bus from Galway to Killarney where on the second day there I took a tour of the Ring of Kerry.  The scenery was amazing.  I easily filled my camera's memory card with photos.<br><br>Dublin captured my heart.  The shopping, restaurants, pubs, St Stephen's Green....and oh yes, the men.  Let's not forget them.",275
