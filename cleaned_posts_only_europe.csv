5,3533,"Tromelin is the smallest of the 4 Scattered Islands I visited.  It is anoval shaped island about 1600 meters (one mile) long and 700 meters(less than half a mile) wide.  It is covered by many low attrative bushesthat the boobies like to nest in.  At the highest end - only 7 meters -is a weather station, a substantial concrete building designed towithstand cyclones which typically hit the island every 3 years.  Thereare 40 or 50 coconut trees around the weather station.  These are theonly trees on the island.There were 6 or 7 people living here: a few weathermen and a fewnaturalists studying birds and turtles.  Unlike the other scattered French islands in the Indian Ocean there is no military presence.The other major features of the island is that it is shaped like asaucer with a depression in the middle so you have an unobstructed viewacross the island as you walk the path that circumnavigates it.  Thelanding strip fits perfectly lengthwise on the island.Finally, there is no reef or lagoon so the waves come crashing into theisland.  It is dangerous to swim because sharks can come almost to theshore.  Basically, the island is a coral reef above the ocean so all yousee is coral and some sand.  Half of the beach is rocky.The main attraction on the island are 2 species of boobies: thered-footed boobie and the masked boobie.  They are fairly comfortablewith people so you can come within 10 meters.  There are some otherbirds as well.The total number of turtle tracks is about 4,000 a year and the peak dayis about 20.  This was surprising to me because of limited sand beaches.In contrast, the Glorioso Islands have superb sand beachs for turtles.Since a female turtle can lay eggs every 12 days for 3 to 7 times.  Thismeans that less than 1000 turtles a year visit Tromlein.The French eradicated the rats in 2005, but there are still some mice.At the weather station there are hundreds and hundreds of hermit crabs.Frequently, one crab will do a take down move on another crab thatusually defends itself successfully for the 5 minutes of the attack, butit can end in canabalism.In the Wikipedia article on Tromelin, one can read the story of theshipwreched slaves in 1761.  We viewed the anchor of the ship at lowtide and 5 of the cannons are still on the beach after all these years!!The journalists on board waded into the ocean to see the other 8 cannonsjust 4 meters off the beach.All of the tourists enjoyed our one day stay on Tromelin and boarded thehelicopter at the end of the day in our usual fashion to return to the Marion Dufresne.Since there is no Gendarme on the island, the ships doctor stamped all ofour passports.",469
0,1,"The Chesterfield Islands are a remote island group nearly halfway between New Caledonia and Australia.  For a few years, I searched for a way to cross between the two, in order to visit Mellish Reef and Chesterfields on the same run but it was too expensive and logistically challenging, due to distance, fuel, and customs requirements.  Finally, I agreed to charter a sportfishing boat, the Quo Vadis, through Pacific Charters in Noumea.<br><br>Quo Vadis is skippered by Olivier Quach, an interesting and accomplished Caledonian of Vietnamese descent.  Direct booking can be made through their family business Powercat Charter (www.powercat-charter.com).  Olivier's brother Gerald is a bodybuilder who was previously ""Mister New Caledonia"", and his friend Michel was a Pacific spearfishing champion.<br><br>We departed Koumac on the northern tip of the mainland the night of 11 December, 2004, and were among the Chesterfields 36 hours later.  Along the way we caught a swordfish, mahi mahi, and a parrotfish, as well as lobster in the lagoon (there was one other fishing boat in the lagoon while we were there).<br><br>We landed on Ile du Loop - the southernmost of the Chesterfields, which we knew to have a marker suitable for a photo, but just in case, the Quach brothers had created a handmade sign reading ""Welcome to Chesterfields"".  Ile du Loop was absolutely covered with red-footed boobys, and it was here that I realized the derivation of ""booby-trap"".  Boobies dig nests in the sandy scrub, then camouflage the holes with brush, creating a dangerous zone for walking, with the potential for broken legs at every step!<br><br>After a fabulous sashimi and lobster dinner, we set out for Noumea at sunset, arriving 36 hours later to catch high tide through the passage into Koumac.  A highlight of the subsequent week in Noumea was dinner at Chez Quach 3 nights later.  Many Vietnamese spring rolls and much American whiskey was consumed that night to celebrate our successful Chesterfields expedition.",8
4,1,"I arrived unexpectedly to Pitcairn today, due to a faulty engine on the Bounty Bay.  Fellow MTP travelers Veikko Huhtala, Oili Liutu, and Elliot Koch are here for the first time, whereas this is my second visit.  I&apos;ve been surprised to find internet and fast phone service, flush toilets, and extended pavement, all of which is new in the last 7 years since I was here.  We are stranded indefinitely until the engine is fixed, but still hope to visit Ducie, Henderson and Oeno on this trip.  The voyage has had several twists and turns which will be documented later; we have only been away for 2 days, and have had about 4 changes of plan!",57
6,1,"Rockall is probably the most difficult island to land on in the world, due to its sheer sides and the rough surrounding North Atlantic seas, which create huge swells even in calm conditions. In 2005, I sailed with British TV personality Ben Fogle from Mallaig, Scotland, on the Eda Frandsen (<a href=""http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/"">http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/)</a> to attempt to land on Rockall, but we turned back in the middle of the night 50 nautical miles away, in the midst of a worsening gale. We spent 2 very nice days at St. Kilda and cruising the Outer Hebrides, but did not approach Rockall. Ben dropped me off at the dock in the tiny outer Hebrides settlement of Leverburgh, and eventually was able to sail back to Rockall the following week, but was unable to land. Ben writes about this adventure in his book &quot;Offshore&quot; (<a href=""http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore"">http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore).</a></p><p>In 2008, I joined &quot;Island Man&quot; Andy Strangeway, 7 other passengers, and 3 crew in Leverburgh to board the Elinca (<a href=""http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/"">http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/</a>), skippered by Angus Smith . Conditions were ideal for the voyage out; in fact, we had to motor due to lack of wind! Nevertheless, swells at Rockall ranged from 15-20 feet, making approach to the side of the island by dinghy impossible. After waiting all day in vain for the swells to subside, Angus sent out his son Innis with a kayak to investigate more closely. Videographer and erstwhile surf instructor Mark Lumsden accompanied Innis with a surfboard.</p><p>Mark astonished us all by bodysurfing the swell towards the rock, then grasping the skirt of kelp, and hauling himself up into a crag in the rock face. Having thus proven the possibility of landing, he climbed to the top and back down, then returned to the ship and gave me his wetsuit to follow. It was difficult, but I landed on the rock! Four other passengers were able to land this way (in sequence, using the same wetsuit) and two of the others were also able to scramble to the top of the rock.</p><p>Unfortunately, Andy Strangeway, the organizer, was unable to land in 2008, but the upside for MTP members is that he will organize another attempt in 2009 (<a href=""http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/"">http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/</a>).</p>",569
8,1,"Clipperton Island is a remote, uninhabited and barren island 700 miles off the Pacific Coast of Mexico. It is an eerie place, and all who have attempted to settle here have either died, fled, or been driven mad (or some combination of the above). Claimed by France, the island was settled for several years by a Mexican garrison. The story of their subsequent downfall is epic in its drama. During WWII, the US Navy tried and failed to land enough equipment to construct a runway on Clipperton. The island was familiar to the US, since FDR made two fishing trips to the island.Although mainly devoid of scenery, Clipperton is home to abundant bird and sea life. The incessant frightened calls of the nesting boobies drove many visitors mad, as did the ubiquitous beady red-eyed land crabs which hide in the sand during the sunny days, then energe at night to swarm and devour any organic materials they can find. Clipperton is also home to some of the most spectacular tuna fishing in the world. In recent years, it has been visited annually by passenger sportfishing boats out of San Diego, including the Royal Star, Red Rooster, Royal Polaris, and Excel. I visited on the Royal Star, and highly recommend their service, whether or not one is a skilled angler. Landing is difficult, due to the encircling reefs, and the ubiquitous sharks. It is rare that a dinghy can actually land on the beach; the US Navy lost several vessels trying to land during WWII. I had to swim roughly 50M through the surf in order to land, and ruined my camera along the way!",10
10,1,"Market Reef is a tiny island shared between Sweden and Finland in the Bothnian Sea. It is uninhabited, but has an abandoned lighthouse. There is a low stone wall which indicates the international border. Market Reef is said to be the smallest island shared by two nations!</P><P>Because Market Reef is on the DXCC list, Finnish DXers visit regularly. So the easiest way would be to tag along with them. Or, if this is not convenient, one can sail (6+ hours) or take a helicopter (20 minutes) starting from Mariehamn, in the Aland islands. Charles chartered the Air Ambulance helicopter from Mariehamn Airport (MHQ). The helicopter company is right next door to the main passenger terminal, and the contact information is: Sk</P>",296
8,111,"<p>I have visited Paris several times, including in September 1992, May 1999 (to attend the French Open), August 2003 (during the brutal heat wave), February 2004, May 2005, May 2006, May 2012, August/September 2012, November 2017 and November 2018. Paris is one of the world&#39;s best museum cities, and I have visited Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Mus&eacute;e Rodin, Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay, Mus&eacute;e Jacquemart-Andr&eacute;, Mus&eacute;e National d&#39;Histoire Naturelle, Galerie de Pal&eacute;ontologie et d&rsquo;Anatomie Compar&eacute;e, Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen Age, Mus&eacute;e de l&#39;Orangerie, Mus&eacute;e Marmottan Monet and Centre Pompidou. Paris also offers a wealth of additional interesting sites, some of my favorites being Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re-Lachaise, H&ocirc;tel des Invalides, Les Catacombes, Les Egouts and Deyrolle, established in 1831 and the world&#39;s best taxidermy shop (http://www.deyrolle.com). Paris is also one of the world&#39;s best dining destinations, and I have eaten in most of the historic restaurants, including Le Procope (opened 1686), Polidor (1845), Aux Charpentiers (1856), Brasserie Flo (1860), Bofinger (1864), Brasserie Lipp (1880), Cafe Les Deux Magots (1885), Taverne Henri IV (1885), Brasserie Balzar (1886), Caf&eacute; de Flore (1887), Chartier (1896), Le Vaudeville (1918), L&#39;Ami Louis (1924), Terminus Nord (1925), Allard (1930), Chez Jenny (1930), Taillevent (1946) and Chez George (1964). In May 2012 I stayed at Hotel La Louisiane, which is rundown but well located and was the hotel of choice of many American jazz musicians, like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bud Powell, during the 1940s and early 1950s (http://www.hotel-lalouisiane.com/).</p>

11,111,"<p>November 2018 -- I spent a few days in Amsterdam on my way to Sierra Leone. &nbsp;On my first full day,&nbsp;I took an early train to &#39;s-Hertogenbosch, where the medieval center was relatively unscathed by World War II. Sint-Janskathedraal represents the height of gothic architecture in the Netherlands, but nowadays tourists visit the cathedral to photograph the statue atop one of its buttresses of an angel wearing jeans, holding a pocketbook and using a mobile phone. Den Bosch&rsquo;s other well known statues are of Jheronimus van Aken, born in &lsquo;s-Hertogenbosch so popularly referred to as Hieronymus Bosch, famous for his nightmarish paintings of the underworld, and the gilded Dragon Fountain. &nbsp;On my second day, I took an early train to meet Els Slots to&nbsp;visit the windmill network at Kinderdijk, less than a half hour from where she lives. Around 1740, the Dutch built nineteen windmills to drain water from low-lying land in the village of Kinderdijk, now the largest concentration of historic windmills in the Netherlands. &nbsp;I also revisited&nbsp;the Rijksmuseum&nbsp;and the Van Gogh Museum.</p>

<p>May 2015 -- I visited several World Heritage Sites, including Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis in Utrecht, Droogmakerij de Beemster (Beemster Polder), Ir.D.F. Woudagemaal (D.F. Wouda Steam Pumping Station), Schokland and Surroundings, and the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Muiden Fortress). I also wandered around Amsterdam, where I ate at Haesje Claes, founded in 1974 (http://www.haesjeclaes.nl/), and drank at Caf&eacute; Hoppe, which has been located on the Spui since 1670 (http://cafehoppe.com/).<br />
<br />
August 2003 -- I made a short visit to Amsterdam while traveling from Nairobi to New York and visited the Rijksmuseum.<br />
<br />
November 2001 -- I based myself in Amsterdam, where I stayed at the American Hotel, established in 1900 and well located on Leidseplein. My primary goal was to visit Mauritshuis, an art museum in The Hague that holds three of the 34 works firmly attributed to Johannes Vermeer, including <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> and <em>View of Delft.</em> I also visited Delft, where I stood on the site where <em>View of Delft</em> was painted, Haarlem and Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, the oldest zoo in the Netherlands.<br />
<br />
August 1994 -- I spent several days in Amsterdam, where I visited Anne Frankhuis, Museum Het Rembrandthuis, the Rijksmuseum, one of the world&#39;s great painting museums, and the Van Gogh Museum. Two of my favorite restaurants on this trip were D&#39;Vijff Vlieghen and the Pancake Bakery (http://www.pancake.nl/), and bars were Caf&eacute; Chris, opened in 1624, and Caf&eacute; Hoppe.</p>

62,111,"September 2017 -- I traveled by ferry from Turku to Mariehamn, the capital of the Åland Islands. Åland, an autonomous territory under Finnish sovereignty, is not part of the EU tax union, which enables duty free sales onboard the ferries.  So nearly all of the passengers made the 5½-hour trip to purchase tobacco and liquor, and, after arriving, they joined another ferry that was immediately returning to Turku.  Only a few passengers disembarked in Mariehamn.  In 2004, a dozen Scandinavian chefs put out the Nordic kitchen manifesto, which essentially launched Nordic cuisine onto the global stage.  I had lunch at Smakbyns, the restaurant founded by Michael Björklund, one of the original twelve signatories to the Nordic kitchen manifesto.  As part of the weekend's Åland Harvest Festival, restaurants featured the bounty from local farms and the sea, and Smakbyns set out a long buffet of local dishes, where the most surprising was braised cormorant, a large seabird.",236
83,111,"June 2017 -- I spent a few days in Wallis and Futuna, where I stayed at Hôtel-Restaurant Lomipeau in Mata-Utu, the capital (http://www.lomipeau.wf).  The hotel is much better than some of its online reviews -- it has a very central location (a short walk from the cathedral and across the street from Maloccino, probably the island's best restaurant); clean room with an excellent ocean view; nice pool; warm water and frigid air conditioning; Wifi much better than expected; and friendly staff, at least two of whom speak English. My favorite restaurant was Maloccino, located across the street from Hotel Lomipeau and opened just a few weeks before my visit (it's one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Pacific).  On my first morning, I walked to the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Matâ'Utu, the largest building in Mata Utu, where I was very lucky to witness a kava ceremony at the King of Uvea Patalione Kanimoa's palace near the cathedral, where dozens of cooked pigs were displayed during a ceremony held in honor of a new deputy minister. French missionaries arrived in Wallis and Futuna in 1837 and, within a few years, had converted almost the entire population to Roman Catholicism. Today, the population of Wallis and Futuna is 99% Catholic.  So, Sundays find most of the population in one of several churches. I attended the early Sunday service (around 6:45 am) at the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Matâ'Utu, the largest church on Wallis. I also visited the Catholic Church in Tepa, one of the most interesting churches in the Pacific.",80

I also made a day trip to Goslar to visit the mine of Rammelsberg and the old town of Goslar, which are jointly inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites as part of the Mines of Rammelsberg, Historic Town of Goslar and Upper Harz Water Management System WHS.  On the day of my departure, I made a morning visit by train to the Fagus Factory in Alfeld, which has also been inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites.",810

90,111,"September 2016 -- I began my trip in Stralsund, a Hanseatic town that has been inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites as part of Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar.  I visited the city's historic center, where the highlights are the Alter Markt, with its 13th-century Gothic Rathaus, and Marienkirche, which was the world's tallest building between 1625 and 1647.  Just outside the historic center, I visited the Ozeaneum, an aquarium that displays primarily sea life of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (https://www.ozeaneum.de).  While traveling by train from Stralsund to Hamburg, I stopped in Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to visit Schweriner Schloss (Schwerin Palace), which is regarded as one of the most important works of romantic Historicism in Europe and is on the list of tentative UNESCO World Heritage Sites as Residence Ensemble Schwerin – Cultural Landscape of Romantic Historicism.",811

92,111,"September 2016 -- I based myself in Lutherstadt Wittenberg, where I visited several of the sites associated with Martin Luther that are recognized as part of the Luther Memorials in Eisleben and Wittenberg WHS, including Lutherhaus (which was the home of Martin Luther for most of his adult life), Stadt- und Pfarrkirche St. Marien zu Wittenberg (where Martin Luther preached and which saw the first celebration of mass in German rather than Latin; it is considered the mother church of the Protestant Reformation), and Schlosskirche (where Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses in October 1517).  I also made a day trip to Dessau to visit Wörlitzer Park, one of the gardens in the Garden Kingdom of Dessau-Wörlitz WHS, and the Bauhaus sites, including the Bauhaus (the most outstanding building in the serial site) and the nearby Masters’ Houses.",816
93,111,"September 2016 -- I visited Leipzig, the largest city in the federal state of Saxony, including Thomaskirche, where Johann Sebastian Bach was the choir director from 1723 until his death in 1750, and the Leipzig Zoological Garden, where the two best exhibits are Pongoland (which displays all four great apes: gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and orangutan) and Gondwanaland (the world's largest indoor rainforest hall).",815
94,111,"September 2016 -- I visited several of the contributing buildings to the Classical Weimar UNESCO World Heritage Site, including Goethe House, the St. Peter und Paul church and the Rococo Hall at the Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, which is the most impressive building in the serial site.  I also visited the Bauhaus buildings in Weimar, which are part of the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar and Dessau WHS, but they are not as interesting as the sites in Dessau, which I visited later during my trip.  My favorite place to drink was the bar at Hotel Elephant, which opened in 1696 (but which was demolished and remodeled in 1937), and to eat was Zum Schwarzen Bären, which opened in 1540 (http://www.schwarzer-baer.de).",818

My favorite dish in Bari, which I had twice, was orecchiette alle cime di rapa (orecchiette was created in Apulia).  I made a day trip by train (https://www.fseonline.it) to Alberobello to see its trulli, traditional Apulian dry stone huts with conical roofs, which are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  I also visited Lecce, which is known as the &#34;Florence of the South&#34; and included on the list of tentative World Heritage Sites as Salento and the Barocco Leccese, and Brindisi to visit the Roman column marking the end of the ancient Via Appia, which is included on the list of tentative World Heritage Sites as Via Appia &#34;Regina Viarum.&#34;",893

122,111,"September 2015 -- I spent three nights in Cagliari at Hotel Miramare, which is centrally located on Via Roma (http://www.hotelmiramarecagliari.it).  The most interesting museums in Cagliari are Le Cere Anatomiche (the Wax Anatomy Museum), which displays many of the most important, highly realistic anatomical models created by Clemente Susini (on a separate trip I had seen many of his anatomical models on display at La Specola, or the Museum of Zoology and Natural History, in Florence), and the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, which exhibits many of the Giants of Mont&apos;e Prama.

0,23,"""A Cruise to Tristan da Cunha Island in the South Atlantic 15-28 January 2004 via the RMS St. Helena"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2004. <br><br>PART ONE:<br><br>The British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), 1,750 miles (2,816 km) southwest of Cape Town and 1,450 miles (2,333 km) southwest of St. Helena Island, is the most remote inhabited island in the world.  Roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo and situated just east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, TDC rises spectacularly some 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) from the seabed; and its peak, snow-covered during the Southern Hemisphere winter, lies 6,760 feet (2,060 meters) above sea level.<br><br>Discovered by the Portuguese admiral Tristao da Cunha in 1506, TDC has been inhabited almost continuously since 1810 due to the activities of sealers who operated in the South Atlantic during the nineteenth century.  A small British garrison was also placed on the island during the early years of Napoleons captivity on nearby St. Helena.<br><br>The correct pronunciation of the Portuguese admiral's name is ""tristan da koon'yah.""  However, the modern-day inhabitants pronounce the name of their island ""tristan da koo'nah."" <br><br>I have been fascinated by the geography and history of remote TDC since<br>I began collecting stamps as a young teenager in the early 1960s.  In 1999 I joined the St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Philatelic Society.  But it was my passion to complete the list of 317 world destinations compiled by the 1,500-member Travelers' Century Club of Los Angeles which recently drove me to take a 13-day cruise round trip from Cape Town to TDC on a luxury cargo vessel, the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS). <br><br>Launched in 1989 by HRH The Prince Andrew, the RMS was the first vessel to be purpose-built for the shipping service to U. K.s South Atlantic islands of St. Helena, Ascension and TDC.  In addition, it was the first passenger ship to be constructed in Britain since the QE2 had been built two decades earlier.<br><br>As we sailed out of Cape Town Harbor, the view from the deck of the RMS  was stunning.  Cape Town, with dramatic Table Mountain behind, is the most beautiful port in the world.  Half way to Cape Point, the RMS turned abruptly and headed toward TDC which lay about 1,748 miles (2,812 km) to the west.<br><br>TDC, a dependency of St. Helena, is administered by the governor of that island, to whom a permanent administrator on TDC reports.  The current governor, H. E. David Hollamby, was also on board the RMS for its final round trip sailing to TDC.  Although the RMS has a capacity of 128 passengers, only 57 were on board for this cruise, along with 56 crew members.  And the RMS was carrying only 38 metric tons of cargo to TDC even though the ship has a cargo capacity of 2,030 metric tons.  Sadly, Governor Hollamby said that it had become impossible to justify the expense of the annual RMS voyage to TDC when usage was so low.  <br><br>Due to rain and clouds on the morning of 21 January, TDC could not be seen until the RMS was only about two miles (3 km) away!  Africa Pilot, published by the U. K. Hydrographic Office, says that TDC, at 37 degrees, 7 minutes S., 12 degrees 18 minutes W., is a ""truncated cone about 6 miles in diameter with its sides rising at an angle of about 45 degrees to a central peak 2,060 meters in height.  The sides of the island consist of walls of inaccessible cliffs from 300 meters to 610 meters in height which rise, except on its northwest side, directly from the sea.  On this side there is, in front of the cliffs, a comparatively low grassy slope from 30 meters to 60 meters high which terminates in Herald Point, the northwest extremity of the island.  The sides of the mountain mass as far as the central dome are covered with brushwood intermixed with ferns and long grass.  But above 1500 meters, coinciding with the normal upper level of clouds, the mountains consist of loose stones and volcanic rubble with occasional rocks and boulders.""  <br><br>The RMS dropped anchor off Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, TDC's only settlement.  Formerly called Somerset, Edinburgh had been renamed after the 1867 visit of HRH The Prince Albert, second son of Queen Victoria.  Interestingly, the current Duke of Edinburgh, HRH The Prince Philip, also visited TDC.  The population of Edinburgh is 285.<br><br>Upon our arrival, some of the crew began fishing off the poop deck for yellowfish and five fingers using hooks and lines with bait; and it seemed as if they were pulling in one fish after the next.  As soon as one fish was snagged, hauled in and placed in a plastic sack, each fisherman re-baited and awaited the next bite, which didn't take long.  The waters off TDC are simply teeming with fish.<br><br>The first boat out to the RMS carried the administrator, the islands only policeman and three immigration officials who sat at a table in the main lounge where passengers who wished to go ashore paid a Sterling 15 (USD 28) landing fee.  Passports were stamped using a rubber stamp with a design showing a yellow-nosed albatross (known locally as a ""mollymauk""), the silhouette of the island and the British crown along with the words, ""Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""<br> <br>Governor Hollamby's official party was in the first boat to go ashore.  I was in the first of two other passenger boats after that.  The use of a rope ladder and safety harness off the RMS in a heavy swell made it very slow going.  Passengers had been warned how dangerous it can be to disembark and embark using the rope ladder as ones foot can be crushed  between the RMS and one of the small boats.  During the past 20 years no passenger injuries had ever resulted from the use of a rope ladder on the RMS at TDC.  But in 2003 one crew member did break his foot.<br><br>Edinburgh's shallow Calshot Harbor was named after the former Royal Air Force station near Southampton where the Tristanians had lived for about a year following their evacuation after a volcanic eruption on TDC in 1961.  Calshot Harbor's two jetties had been sturdily constructed of double-ended anchor-shaped concrete blocks.<br><br>Removing the life vest I had worn ashore in the boat, I walked up the paved road to the often-photographed sign which reads, ""Welcome to the Remotest Island - Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""  Adjacent to that sign is a marker which points the direction and mileage to various points around the globe:  Nightingale Island is 22 miles (35 km) away, the Falkland Islands are 2,166 miles (3,485 km) away and London is 5,337 miles (8,587 km) away.<br><br>After visiting the post office, I walked to the three-room museum and handicraft center.  The museum featured a copy of the flag of Jonathan Lambert, an American who had declared himself emperor of the ""Islands of Refreshment"" (TDC) in 1811.  The ensign of the Duke of Edinburgh, which last flew at TDC during the January 1957 royal visit of HRH The Prince Philip, was also displayed.  In addition, a cannon ball and various old rusted implements were shown.  In another room unique TDC wingless moths were displayed as were various geological specimens, a TDC crayfish (fishing for crayfish, or rock lobster, is the mainstay of the economy) and even the head of a rare Tasman whale which had once beached in the TDC Archipelago.  In that same room was a photocopy obtained from the British Museum of TDC's original constitution which dated back to 1817.<br><br>Then I went by the Rectory to the Residency, where the administrator  resides.  There a vintage cannon rests on the well-manicured lawn near the flagpole from which the Union Jack flies.  <br><br>Behind the Residency is a 9-hole golf course.  Apparently a spare set of golf clubs at the Residency can be borrowed, and a certificate is issued to those who have played the course.  Blue TDC Golf Club ties were also sold as souvenirs on the island. <br><br>As I walked up the paved lane along the side of the Residency, I noticed a number of canvas sailboats which had been tied down there with ropes in order to prevent their being blown about by strong winds.  <br><br>My next stop was Prince Philip Hall, the community center.  The roof of this building was blown off during a hurricane which struck Edinburgh in May 2001.  Currently the school hall nearby is used for community gatherings.  <br><br>I walked through the paved lanes of the settlement past many small houses with lovely flowers in their gardens.  The most prominent of the flowers were the hydrangeas.  Strolling along, I was struck by the large number of automobiles parked in the driveways.  Most vehicles seemed to have 4-wheel drive capability, but I did notice one small sedan car too.  Painted bright red, it seemed a bit out of place.  There was also a farm tractor with a flatbed trailer in Edinburgh.<br><br>Then I crossed a small stream and struck out across a daisy-filled cow pasture toward the lava cone formed by the eruption which began in October 1961.  After climbing over a low lava rock wall and skirting a few inquisitive cows grazing in the fields, I hiked up along the grassy ravine adjacent to the volcanic cone, following some well-trodden cow paths.  About half way up I turned and took a photograph over the settlement.  <br><br>From my high vantage point I could also see Edinburgh's small water reservoir to my left at the base of the steep cliffs.  The water drunk on TDC is precipitation that has fallen high on the mountain in the form of rain or snow and has filtered down through the basalt, finally emanating from a spring near the settlement.  Those who have drunk TDC water say that it has a fine taste.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>PART TWO:<br><br>In January 2004 I enjoyed a unique cruise on the final voyage of the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS) round trip from Cape Town to the remote British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo.  <br><br>During my eight hours in TDC's only settlement, Edinburgh, which has a population of 285, I wandered into Jane's Café, the islands only restaurant, where I found a number of other RMS passengers enjoying drinks, sandwiches and dessert.  As crayfish (rock lobster) is the mainstay of TDCs economy, it was not surprising that crayfish sandwiches were sold at the café.  Chocolate sponge cake, beer and soft drinks were also available.  The proprietress took little notice of me as she continued her knitting.  A notice to the islands 285 residents posted on the cafe's bulletin board by the dental nurse warned that appointments for the upcoming dental visit had to be made at the hospital before 28 January 2004.  Outside Jane's Cafe were the only public W. C.s in Edinburgh.   <br><br>As I found the door unlocked, I photographed the interior of the empty Roman Catholic Church nearby.  Although I had passed the Rectory earlier, I never did find Edinburgh's Anglican Church which is said to contain an old photograph of Queen Victoria.<br><br>Continuing my walk, I passed Camogli Hospital.  The operating room and the X-ray machine in this facility suffered severe damage in a 2001 hurricane.  Nowadays from the outside one would never guess that the hurricane had caused one-quarter of the building to collapse. <br><br>At the far end of Edinburgh is a typical British bus stop sign.  Walking down the cement road beyond the sign, I found myself at the bottom of a steep, dry ravine.  In rainy times I imagined that this gulch must turn into a raging torrent of water, pushing boulders in its path.  The road was not paved across the floor of the gulch, but the cement did continue again up the far bank.  I continued to the top of the far embankment and saw a wide expanse of grassland ahead.  The paved road extended all the way beyond the grassy cinder cone in the distance to the Potato Patches which lie some 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away.  There islanders cultivate potatoes and other crops.  And I have read that on Friday afternoons a vehicle does in fact take residents from the Edinburgh bus stop to their ""weekend homes"" in the potato patches!   <br><br>Then I walked to the school on the opposite side of Edinburgh.  Along the way I took photographs of some of the settlement's dogs.  Though I passed many dogs today, not a single animal barked at me and only one even came up to sniff me.  In the school hall I purchased a first day cover from one of the women selling handicrafts and souvenirs.  I also made a donation to the headmistress for the school. <br><br>Beyond the school toward the lava flow lie three graveyards surrounded by low lava rock walls.  One graveyard is Anglican, another is Roman Catholic and a third is apparently for Freemasons.  All graves appeared to be well-tended and most were covered with cut flowers.  Outside the lava walls cows grazed lazily in the fields.<br><br>As I had heard that rockhopper penguins could sometimes be seen at Pigbite, the beach beyond the 1961 lava flow, I next wandered in that direction.  The half hour walk over the lava flow to a beach with large boulders revealed where TDC's outdated heavy equipment and various pieces of scrap metal had been junked.  This is also where TDC's garbage is burned.    <br><br>While I never did find any penguins, my walk over to the beach was an interesting one.  On the side of the road in the direction of Edinburgh I noticed huge fissures in the lava.  These fissures could only have been created by earthquakes.  Then when I reached the far side of the lava flow I saw a small waterfall created by a spring emanating from a point low on the cliff.  The wind was gusting strongly as I stepped over a small brook and began to walk across a grassy field.  There I was able to photograph a few skuas resting in a depression.  The large birds let me approach more closely than I had expected, but eventually they rose and floated away in the wind. <br><br>From the beach I returned to Edinburgh.  Realizing that I was hungry, I dropped into the local supermarket to purchase a small imported apple for eight pence.  The supermarket stocks many types of canned goods and dry goods plus frozen items and even handicrafts, including knitted sweaters.  While the fruit and vegetable department was nothing like back home, that was perfectly understandable, considering its location.  In general, though, I was surprised at just how much variety was available at the supermarket.  Adjacent to it were other stores selling plumbing and electrical goods.<br><br>In the early evening a final boat removed all passengers who wished to return to the RMS.  I often prefer to be one of the last persons to enter a small boat in order to avoid having to rock and roll while waiting for all the other passengers to board.  Consequently, because of my physical position in the boat, sometimes I am one of the first people to disembark.  <br><br>That was the case this time.  When I climbed the rope ladder up into the RMS, the small boat was sitting relatively still in the water.  But I had to hang around to wait for my backpack to be lifted up along with all the other loose passenger gear.  So I was in a good position to hear the horror stories told by those pale passengers who did not disembark until the very end.  Apparently shortly after I climbed the rope ladder the wind had shifted, causing the small boat to begin to flip around fairly violently.<br><br>What kind of person would ever consider taking a 13-day round trip cruise from Cape Town to TDC, you might wonder?  <br><br>The RMS passenger list included Jan and Kirsten, a Norwegian couple who seemed to specialize in traveling to obscure places.  Jan showed me his passport which even contained a visa for the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which surrounded by Azerbaijan.  This enclave is not on the Travelers' Century Club list and, interestingly, Jan and Kirsten had never even heard of the Travelers' Century Club.<br><br>TDC was the 286th Travelers' Century Club destination for George, a retired American doctor.  After Cape Town he planned to spend five days on Rodrigues Island, a dependency of Mauritius, before flying home to San Diego via the Kalahari and the Algarve.  George was finishing a five-month trip in fulfillment of his quest.  And, though we are fellow Travelers' Century Club members, George's quest was much more involved than my own.  In addition to traveling to all 317 world destinations on the Travelers' Century Club list, he was also trying to visit all of the world's major natural features such as deserts, etc.   <br><br>Richard, the only other American on board, planned to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway next year from Moscow to Vladivostok.  Like a surprising number of others on board, he was a repeat passenger on the RMS, having previously sailed to St. Helena and Ascension.<br><br>Walter, one of a number of Germans on the RMS, was the Hamburg-based producer of the German television crew.  He once spent a week filming on Jan Mayen Land, a Norwegian island situated between Spitzbergen and Iceland, and had also traveled to remote parts of Iran and Oman.  Incidentally, Walter, who once worked in Cairo as a journalist and is married to a Palestinian, was the only other Arabic speaker on board aside from myself.  <br><br>Stan, a retired professor of Canadian studies from Fredericton, NB, had been involved with philately since the age of six.  His interest in postal history led him to visit some stamp shops in Cape Town prior to the cruise in order to check out their covers.<br><br>Others, like South Africans James and Tara, booked at the last minute and benefited from a 50% fare discount.<br><br>John, a discriminating traveler from London, planned to take an 80-day round-the-world cruise on the Oriana next year.<br><br>There were five Swiss on the RMS.  Jean, Yves and Leopoldine, three friends from Geneva, were avid sailors who, in their younger days, used to sail their yacht around Europe at every opportunity.  Stefan, from Zurich, was an experienced and sophisticated traveler who had rented a house and car for a week-long holiday in a seaside suburb of Cape Town nearly every Northern Hemisphere winter for the last 15 years.  He confided that South Africa represented excellent value for the Swiss.  <br><br>Stefan's lively and inquisitive friend Yalgin, of Turkish extraction but with a Swiss passport, was interested in odd destinations.  Yalgin, who collected airline sickness bags, entertained us at dinner one night with stories about Busingen and Campione dal Italia, German and Italian enclaves in Switzerland, respectively, and about Samnaun, a Swiss town which must be accessed from Austria as no direct road connection exists with Switzerland.    <br><br>Dacre, a former pilot for British Airways and later, after retirement, with Singapore Airlines, and his wife Ann were booked on the RMS all the way north to Ascension.  Both spent their childhood years in Chile, where they met.  Dacre was fascinated by the controls on the bridge, and our captain took special pleasure in explaining the instruments to him.  Dacre collected old airline timetables, some of which are apparently very valuable.<br><br>The remaining passengers were mostly British but with a number of Germans and South Africans also in evidence.  Surprisingly, several elderly British were on the passenger list.  Some were traveling alone.  Eve mentioned that she had taken the RMS to St. Helena on another occasion and came along on this cruise to TDC as the captain had told her how interesting TDC was.<br><br>In spite of their varied travel experiences, most passengers felt that this cruise to Tristan da Cunha on the RMS St. Helena was a unique experience which they will remember for the rest of their lives. <br><br><BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",235

HELENA ISLAND:<BR><BR>""St. Helena Sightseeing and a Surprise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2006 </P><P>With Captain Christopher Turner at the helm, Holland America Line's elegant MS <I>Prinsendam</I> slowly approached the anchorage in James Bay off the north coast of the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic on the morning of 14 November 2006 after a 66-hour crossing from Luderitz, Namibia. As it eased to a stop and dropped anchor, the 38,000-ton <I>Prinsendam</I> passed the much smaller, 6,700-ton RMS <I>St. Helena</I>, which already lay at anchor closer to shore. The royal mail ship is the only vessel which regularly links the British overseas territories of St. Helena and Ascension with Walvis Bay, Namibia and Cape Town. <BR><BR>Discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese navigator Joao da Nova and briefly occupied twice by the Dutch during the seventeenth century, St. Helena has been in English possession continuously since 1673. At that time the English East India Company used the island as a stop on the voyage to India via the Cape of Good Hope. In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte was brought to St. Helena and detained there until his death in 1821. The island was also used for the detention of some 5,000 Boer prisoners during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. The economy of St. Helena prospered when the island was used as a port of call for ships plying the route to India and the Cape Colonies. However, the construction of the Suez Canal reduced the frequency of such long sea voyages. Since World War II the prosperity of the island has continued to decrease. However, there are now plans afoot to build an airport on St. Helena in order to help boost the island's economy. Currently it is hoped that the new airport will open by 2012. <BR><BR>At 10 a.m. the <I>Prinsendam</I>, Holland America's oldest (built in 1988) and smallest (793 passengers) liner, commenced tender operations from the ship to the Jamestown wharf. Our touring party that day consisted of a dozen Americans. Most members of our group had embarked in Lisbon on 17 October for the entire 46-day ""Taste of Two Continents"" cruise to Ft. Lauderdale via Cape Town. Prior to St. Helena the <I>Prinsendam</I> had called at a dozen ports in ten African countries from Morocco to South Africa. <BR><BR>After stepping ashore at the Jamestown pier our party was met by Tracey Corker. Tracey and her amiable father Colin operate Corkers Tourist Services. Colin's father had imported one of the first vehicles into St. Helena in the early 1930s. That 1929 Chevrolet Charrabanc, an open touring car which had been manufactured for export in the U. S. with right-hand drive, is still in good running order today; and it can hold up to 16 passengers. Our party had pre-arranged a full-day island tour in Colin's unique green car which is well known on the island. Colin's father had installed a convertible cover for use in rainy weather. The occasional heavy mist we experienced in the uplands that day, said to be unusual for St. Helena in late spring, made use of the convertible cover necessary for awhile. <BR><BR>Our St. Helena sightseeing tour began with a group photo in the Chevy Charrabanc on Main Street in Jamestown. Then, with Colin at the wheel, we proceeded to drive up Side Path, the steep single-lane switchback road carved into the eastern side of the narrow ravine in which Jamestown is located. Colin kept the throttle in low gear for the entire uphill climb as the road rises nearly 600 meters (2,000 feet) in only about 3 km (2 miles). <BR><BR>Our first lengthy stop was made about half an hour later near Napoleon's fenced but inscriptionless tomb. After a 10-minute walk down a wide path we reached the spot at the head of Sane Valley where Napoleon had originally been interred at his death in 1821 after six years in residence on the island. Napoleon's remains were removed to Paris in 1840. I found that the tomb site had been much improved since my first visit to St. Helena in March 2001. Whereas previously a simple grassy area had surrounded the tomb, now there is a well-manicured garden off to one side. The French tricolor continues to fly from a short flagpole near the guard's kiosk. This spot and Longwood House, our next stop, were ceded to France in 1858. <BR><BR>The grounds of Longwood House, Napoleon's residence on St. Helena, were as beautiful as ever. Napoleon's sunken garden pathways, on which he could stroll without being seen from afar, remain in evidence. However, I found that Longwood House had been changed in one important respect since my last visit. While the entrance on the east side of the building is unchanged, the exit is no longer through the long green trellis on the same side. Now visitors can only leave via a gift shop on the north side of the house. The gift shop, which bears the sign of Hutt's Gate Store on the wall behind the counter, offers every sort of Napoleon-related souvenir imaginable, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. But, since Longwood House still has no entrance fee, one can hardly complain. Non-flash photography is allowed in the house but video photography is not. <BR><BR>From Longwood House we returned back to the island's circular road. En route we passed Hutt's Gate Store. Once an inn frequented by Napoleon's guards, Colin mentioned that currently the store is up for auction. <BR><BR>The interior one-third of St. Helena is foliated and resembles England. Southeast trade winds carry mists which shroud the highest slopes and help create lush uplands. During our tour around the island Colin pointed out a couple of disused flax mills. The flax industry was established on St. Helena in the early years of the twentieth century. New Zealand flax, said to grow best on St. Helena's highest ground, was baled and exported to England and South Africa where it was made into hemp. However, the flax industry collapsed in the mid-1960s when the British General Post Office began to employ nylon rather than hemp manufactured from St. Helena-grown flax. <BR> <BR>As the afternoon wore on, our party paused en route at the Solomon & Co. shop at Silver Hill for some refreshments of candy and cookies. Fifteen minutes later we passed Sandy Bay, which forms part of a large sunken crater. Unfortunately foggy conditions made it difficult to discern Lot and Lot's Wife, two giant basalt pillars which jut up from the lunar landscape in the south of the island. The beautiful vistas of the blue sea beyond the island's arid coast were also obscured by the fog and mist. During our tour Colin pointed out three new senior citizens' residences which have been constructed by the government in recent years at various places around the island. <BR><BR>Later we passed St. Paul's Cathedral. St. Helena is a bishopric in the province of the Church of South Africa, and most of St. Helena's remaining inhabitants are Anglican. Since winning the right of abode in the United Kingdom the island's population has shrunk somewhat. Colin thought that the current population is probably in the range of 3,500 whereas St. Helena's population had been as high as 6,000 in the past.<br><br>Our next stop was at Plantation House, the home of St. Helena 's governors since 1792.  While it is thought that several other houses preceded the current house, the locations of these earlier houses are unknown.  The first such governor's house may have been built of wood as early as 1673.  The present site of Plantation House was provided by the East India Company. <br><br>Plantation House's Georgian facade faces onto a wide fenced lawn which is home to at least five giant tortoises ranging in weight from 55 kg. (121 pounds) to approximately 200 kg. (440 pounds).  We photographed Jonathan, the Seychelles tortoise who was brought to St. Helena as a mature adult in 1882.  Based on the assumption that a tortoise is mature when it is about 50 years of age, Jonathan's current age has been estimated at approximately 174.  Jonathan is said to be the oldest known member of his species, Testudinipae cytodira .  Jonathan lives on the grounds along with David, Emma, Fredricka andMyrtle.  These other four giant tortoises have joined Jonathan on the lawn of Plantation House only since the late 1960s.  While occasionally eggs are laid by the female tortoises, none has ever produced offspring. <br><br>From Plantation House we drove down to the Jamestown suburb long known at Half Tree Hollow.  Colin mentioned that nowadays locals most often refer to this area as Three Tanks after the three red water tanks currently in use there.  From that point we continued down to Ladder Hill in order to photograph Jamestown far below.  Jacob's Ladder, with 699 almost-vertical steps, is said to be the longest staircase in the world.  It was built by the Royal Engineers in 1829 to link Jamestown with High Knoll Fort, situated on the cliff above. <br><br>Our party's island tour concluded in front of the post office on Main Street in Jamestown; and it was there and then that I had long planned a special surprise for Barbara Stein, my significant other of nine years.  Barbara and I have considered ourselves a couple almost since we met when we sat next to each other on a bus during a travel agents' tour of Iran in 1997.  As avid and frequent travelers to exotic places, Barbara and I have often joked privately of marrying at the South Pole.  But we both knew that in reality only a winning lottery ticket ever would have made that possible.  We also knew that, because a wedding far from the U. S. would make it difficult for friends and family to attend, South Florida is the most logical place for the wedding itself.  <br><br>During the spring of 2006 it occurred to me that the only way to add an exotic geographical component to our marriage would be for me to propose to Barbara at some distant locale.  Since our Holland America Lisbon-to-Ft. Lauderdale cruise via Cape Town had been anticipated since mid-2005, I determined to propose to Barbara on November 14 on the steps of the main post office in Jamestown.  Because I wanted to surprise her, I told Barbara nothing about the engagement ring I had made for her in Cairo in the summer of 2006.  However, I did inform our friends who were to tour with us in St . Helena.  Unbeknownst to me, they proceeded to purchase and then sneak two bottles of champagne, plastic cups, and confetti along on the tour that day.   <br><br>At the end of our island tour I assembled our party of 12 for a group photo on the steps of the Jamestown post office.  Afterward I employed the ruse of asking Barbara to pose with me for a separate photo in order to separate her from the rest of the group.  It was then that I got down on my knee on the step of the post office and slipped an alexandrite engagement ring onto her finger, asking if she would marry me in November 2007.  Uncharacteristically, a flabbergasted Barbara appeared to find herself at a complete loss for words.  However, she soon gave me a positive response; and then bubbly was poured for all.  As it was late in the day and there were no customers, even the three ladies working in the main post office, all of whom had been watching from behind the counter inside, joined us in celebrating! <br><br>Before leaving the premises I posted a couple of dozen postcards at the post office.  I was told that my cards would be carried on the RMS St. Helena , which was scheduled to depart on 15 November for Cape Town.  A notice outside the post office cautioned that 14 November was the deadline for posting surface mail to the U. K. before Christmas. <br><br>For the convenience of cruise passengers, on 16 November the St. Helena Development Agency sponsored a trade fair.  Over a dozen vendors set up stands in the small park between the moat and the side of the Castle, just to the east of the Archway at the entrance to Jamestown.  Items offered for sale included the following:  locally-produced Tungi wine; locally-grown coffee; canned tuna fish from the St. Helena Cannery; embroidery and crocheted articles; tea towels; shoulder bags; shopping bags; aprons; T-shirts; caps; mugs; calendars; cookbooks; jams; pressed flower pictures; woodcraft items; post cards; a DVD about the island; and a CD by a local artist. <br><br>After our eight-hour call at St. Helena the Prinsendam continued on to Ascension Island and four Brazilian ports plus Barbados and the Bahamas before finishing the cruise in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  Unfortunately on 16 November a heavy swell and strong winds made tendering into Georgetown too dangerous.  So instead Captain Turner elected to circumnavigate Ascension before MS Prinsendam proceeded on the 73-hour passage to Fortaleza, Brazil. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",232

In fact, most visitors proceed directly to their resort accommodations east or west of Faro by rental car, completely bypassing the city of Faro, which is the most populated town in the Algarve and its capital.<BR><BR>Many holiday villages are clustered around quaint Albufeira, which is situated near excellent beaches northwest of Faro. Albufeira is one of the Algarve's largest and most popular resort destinations. <BR><BR>An excellent day trip through the western part of the Algarve can be made by car using Albufeira as a base. The circuit includes the Moorish capital of Silves, the historic Sagres where Prince Henry the Navigator once dwelled, nearby Cape Vincent, and the small port of Lagos founded by the Phoenicians.<BR><BR>Silves, situated in the hills 18 km (11 miles) northeast of the port of Portimao, was the grand home of the Moorish kings who ruled the province of Al-Gharb which, incidentally, means ""the West"" in Arabic. Silves' picturesque medieval Moorish castle is the largest in the Algarve. Today a gigantic Crusader statue standing just outside the castle serves to remind that this fortress was sacked by Crusaders in 1189. Wonderful views of the surrounding countryside can be had from the walls of the castle, which still dominates Silves today. The town also boasts a Gothic cathedral built on the site of an old mosque. The streets of Silves are still laid out just as they were in the medieval medina. <BR><BR>It was at Sagres in the fifteenth century that Prince Henry the Navigator established his navigation school at which Magellan, Cabral and da Gama all studied. Today Prince Henry's fortaleza is the principal tourist site at Sagres. A fifteenth-century stone wind compass 43 meters (140 feet) in diameter dominates the entrance to the fortress, and there are spectacular sea views over the tall cliffs from the long walkway along the ancient walls. Interestingly, within the fortress, the altar of the sixteenth-century Church of Our Lady of Grace depicts Saint Vincent holding a ship.<BR><BR>Cape Vincent, Portugal's westernmost promontory, has been inhabited since the Neolithic era. In Classical times the cape was thought to be sacred. After the remains of Saint Vincent were brought there following the Arab invasion, Cape Vincent drew pilgrims for centuries. Today this spectacular but windy western promontory sports only a lighthouse, a tiny tourist market, and few fishermen trying their luck. <BR><BR>En route back to Albufeira is the fishing town of Lagos whose natural harbor attracted the Phoenicians. Later the Moors settled in Lagos until the town was retaken by Christian forces in 1241. Prince Henry used Lagos as a base for his African trade. In fact, Europe's first slave market was in Lagos. Today the town is known mainly for its nearby cliffs, coves and beautiful beaches and for the convenient motorway which now connects it with Lisbon, Faro and even with Spain. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN ><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 February 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com </FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com </FONT></A></SPAN></SPAN></P>",305
12,23,"HOW TO GET TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:</P><P><!--StartFragment -->Normally about half a dozen cruise ships call at Pitcairn annually. However, only occasionally do any of these cruise ships ever land passengers on the island. When this does happen, it is almost always one of the islanders' longboats which is used to transport people ashore. Yacht charters to Pitcairn are possible from Mangareva in French Polynesia. These charters can be arranged via an agent in the U. S. Finally, supply vessels visit Pitcairn on an irregular basis, either from Mangareva or once in awhile from New Zealand. It might be possible to purchase passage on one of these sailings.</P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:<BR><BR>""A Visit to Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2003 </P><P>On 25 January 2003 I sailed from Valparaiso, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on the 513-passenger German-registered cruise ship MS Deutschland. During the 16-day cruise the Deutschland called at Chile's Robinson Crusoe Island, Easter Island and Pitcairn Island as well as Fakarava and Moorea in French Polynesia. On 4 February I landed at Pitcairn in smooth seas and got to explore that island for half a day. <BR><BR>I had first attempted to land at Pitcairn during a previous cruise on the Deutschland in August 2000. However, that attempt was frustrated by a 3-meter sea swell. No passengers were allowed to disembark from the Deutschland that time. Then in November 2002 during a second Pitcairn attempt aboard the Seven Seas Navigator I did manage to land. But because passengers were recalled to the ship after only 20 minutes, I never had a chance to explore anything but Pitcairn's dock area. <BR><BR>I have been fascinated by faraway Pitcairn Island for nearly 40 years. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read Nordhoff and Hall's Bounty Trilogy novels (Mutiny on the Bounty, Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island) and began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. <BR><BR>One of the most remote of the world's inhabited islands, Pitcairn lies in the South Pacific Ocean roughly midway between Tahiti and Easter Island. Pitcairn Island is 4,155 nautical miles (nm) southwest of Los Angeles, 3,504 nm northwest of Santiago, Chile and 3,314 nm northeast of Wellington, New Zealand. Pitcairn is 11,281 nm from Cairo.<BR><BR>Pitcairn was discovered in 1767 by a midshipman named Pitcairn aboard HMS Swallow, but the island was not settled until 1790 when Fletcher Christian and his band of mutineers arrived aboard the Bounty. In a tale immortalized on film by Clark Gable and Charles Laughton (1934), Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard (1962) and Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (1984), Fletcher Christian seized the Bounty from Captain William Bligh and eventually steered it to Pitcairn Island.<BR><BR>The Bounty had sailed from England in 1787 on a mission to gather breadfruit trees in Polynesia and transport them to the British West Indies where, it was thought, breadfruit would provide a new, cheap source of food for slaves on the sugar plantations. After ten months and 27,000 nm of sailing, the Bounty finally arrived in Tahiti. During the five months which the ship remained in Tahiti while young breadfruit trees were cultivated, many of the crew became captivated by the local women. <BR><BR>The famous mutiny on the Bounty took place some 3 1/2 weeks into the sail from Tahiti westward toward the West Indies. Bligh and 18 loyal crew were set adrift in a longboat. Against all odds nearly all of these men eventually reached Dutch-held Timor (Indonesia) after a 3,600-nm open boat voyage. Meanwhile, Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers returned to Tahiti for their women. After leaving behind at Tahiti 16 men who wished to remain, nine mutineers and their women plus nine other Polynesian men and women roamed the Pacific for several months in search of an island on which they could hide. Eventually Fletcher Christian sailed the Bounty to Pitcairn which, fortunately, had been charted incorrectly by 200 miles. There the Bounty was burned to hide all evidence of the mutineers' arrival.<BR><BR>Most of the 50 current inhabitants of Pitcairn are descendants of the original Bounty mutineers and the Polynesians who accompanied them. Some of the others are descendants of shipwrecked sailors who decided to remain on the island and marry.<BR><BR>The Pitcairn Islands, which consist of Pitcairn plus the uninhabited Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, are today administered as a British colony via an administrative headquarters in New Zealand. Pitcairn's island council handles such local affairs as island maintenance, postal and medical services and communications. Pitcairn's chief source of income derives from the sale of postage stamps to collectors. <BR><BR>About one mile wide and two miles long, Pitcairn is of volcanic origin. The highest point on the island is some 1,100 feet. The land is hilly but fertile; and the islanders grow sweet potatoes, yams, pineapples, cabbages, beans, tomatoes, citrus and bananas. There are no farm animals, although poultry and wild goats exist on the island. <BR><BR>Pitcairn is completely surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs. There is only one small harbor, at Bounty Bay. Access to this harbor is via longboat operated by the islanders. A longboat carries about two dozen passengers on an open deck. Even in calm seas getting into and out of a Pitcairn longboat while it is alongside a cruise ship can be challenging. The longboat bobs up and down with the waves, so the timing of one's step is everything. On my previous landing at Pitcairn I had to climb down a rope ladder and then jump ""blind"" into a longboat when instructed to do so by the crew. Luckily this time the Deutschland employed an external stairway. But even the slight sea swell still made the step into the longboat an exciting one. <BR><BR>Upon landing on the island, I first had my photograph taken in front of the ""Welcome to Pitcairn Island"" sign above the boathouse. The next order of business was climbing the so-called Hill of Difficulty to reach the small settlement of Adamstown, named for the last surviving mutineer. One of the Bounty anchors is displayed in the small town square. Facing the square are the post office, the courthouse, the museum, the library and a Seventh Day Adventist church. In the church is one of the original Bounty bibles. <BR><BR>I was fortunate to be offered a tour of the entire island in an open all-terrain vehicle. The first stop was on a hilltop called Ship Landing Point overlooking Bounty Bay from where I could view Adamstown. Above the settlement is a large cave where Fletcher Christian maintained a watch out over the sea. <BR><BR>Then we drove to St. Paul's Point. Directly below, islanders can enjoy an ocean swim in a pool which is afforded protection by large boulders. On the way we passed a very steep trail leading to ""Down Rope."" There on the cliff face are inscribed Polynesian petroglyphs. From these markings and a few stone tools found on the island it is known that Polynesians visited Pitcairn long before the arrival of the Bounty mutineers. <BR><BR>My tour continued to Tautama where I saw wild goats grazing. Then we drove to Taro Ground where the radio station is situated. Ham radio enthusiasts from around the world are ever eager to make contact with remote Pitcairn. We went on to the highest point on the island, and from there we drove down Garnet's Ridge back to Adamstown. On the way I took in views of beautiful uninhabited ""Tedside."" This term is apparently a corruption of the phrase ""the other side.""<BR><BR>Back in Adamstown, I visited the schoolhouse. A school teacher from New Zealand is posted to the island on a two-year contract. I also saw the unoccupied and delapidated house of Thursday October Christian, Fletcher Christian's first son, who died in 1866. Nearby is the cemetery which contains gravestones dating back to the nineteenth century. <BR><BR>On the way back to the longboat I stopped at The Edge which overlooks Bounty Bay. There rests the anchor of the Acadia, one of the many ships which has foundered in the Pitcairn Islands over the years. The Acadia ran aground at Ducie Island in 1881. The anchor was raised and carried to Pitcairn in 1990.<BR><BR>While I had been exploring Pitcairn during the morning, about 35 islanders had come aboard the Deutschland to sell their wooden handicrafts, woven baskets, T-shirts and postage stamps. So after a quick lunch I shopped for wooden turtles, my favorite Pitcairn handicraft. I also purchased a large model of a Pitcairn longboat.<BR><BR>During afternoon tea three of the islanders were interviewed in the ship's auditorium. Then it was time for the Pitcairners to bid us goodbye. As they sailed away in their longboat, the islanders looked up at the ship's passengers crowded along the railings and sang us a farewell song. <BR> <BR>For further information about the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and about Pitcairn Island, visit <A href=""http://www.lareau.org/"" eudora=""autourl"">www.lareau.org</A>, which contains many useful links.

22,23,"<body><p>""<b>Malta, a Jewel in the Mediterranean</b>,"" written for the   expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2009 </p><p>Strategic Malta is situated in the Mediterranean Sea 93 km (58 miles) south of Sicily and 300 km (186 miles) north of Libya.  A member of the European Union since 1994, this tiny republic consists of three limestone islands:  246-square-km (94-square-mile) Malta, 61-square-km (24-square-mile) Gozo, and 3-square-km (1-square-mile) Comino.  The sprawling capital of Valletta and most of the national population of 403,000 are located on the island of Malta, which measures 27 km (17 miles) by 14.5 km (9 miles).  On the other hand, Gozo's population is only 31,000; and a mere eight people reside on Comino.  <br><br>Because barren Malta boasts no mountains, lakes or rivers, half of its fresh water requirements must be supplied through reverse osmosis.  Malta's two official languages are the Semitic Malti and English.  The latter is a reflection of the British presence in Malta from 1798 to 1979.  <br><br>Malta was first populated about 5000 B. C.  Between 3600 B. C. and 2,500 B. C. a number of stone temples were constructed, about two dozen of which still survive.  Malta was a Phoenician colony between 800 B. C. and 218 B. C.  Then, after the fall of Carthage, these islands were controlled by Rome.  The Arabs ruled from 870 A. D. until their expulsion in 1090 by King Roger of Sicily.  The Knights of St. John arrived in 1530 and remained for 268 years.  Napoleon held Malta for a two-year period from 1798.  This was followed by British rule until late in the twentieth century.  <br><br>The most famous event in Malta's history is the Great Siege of 1565 when an Ottoman fleet appeared carrying 30,000 men.  After a bloody three-month siege, relief finally arrived from Sicily; so the Ottomans withdrew.  Malta also suffered five months of severe bombing in 1942.<br><br>At the crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea, Malta's rich and fascinating history is a big draw for tourists.  The sunny climate is another factor which has contributed to the creation of a substantial tourism industry.  Over a million tourists visit Malta annually, and tourism represents up to 40% of Malta's gross national product.  Probably best known for its spectacular Grand Harbor, Malta's other top tourist sites include:  the baroque St. John's Co-cathedral constructed in 1573; the Grand Master's Palace built in 1571; star-shaped Fort St. Elmo at the mouth of the harbor; and the waterfront district of Vittoriosa.  Casa Rocca Piccola in downtown Valletta is also well worth a visit.  Constructed in the 1580s for the Knights of St. John, its current owner is a member of the de Piro Family.  The house may be viewed only by guided tour.<br><br>In the interior of Malta is the medieval walled village of Mdina, which today has a population of only 400.  Mdina's primary attraction is the baroque St. Paul's Cathedral built between 1697 and 1702.<br><br>Since flying time from Cairo is only two hours, Malta is ideal for a 3-day or 4-day getaway.  It is best to visit during the dry season months of April, May, June, September and October.  July and August are also good, although it is hotter then.  From November through February is the rainy season, with most precipitation falling in December and January.  Round trip airfare from Cairo to Malta on Egypt Air is EGP 2,500.  Egypt Air flies both ways on Thursday and Sunday.  Travel on any other day of the week requires a change of aircraft in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.  Travelers with a full week to spare should consider combining Malta with nearby Sicily.  Round trip ferries between Malta and Sicily begin from about Euro 100.<font size=""3""> </font><span style=""color: black""> </span></p><font size=""4""><a target=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtYjRq_fQjc"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=bpFX2yl6vkk"">Sailaway from Malta's Grand Harbor, 112-second video clip</a></font><br> <p>  <span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman""><b>Ted Cookson<br>  Manager - Maadi<br>  Egypt Panorama Tours<br>  Cairo, Egypt<br>  21 May 2009<br>  <a href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com</a><br>  <a href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com</a> </b></p></body>",294

30,23,"""Viewing HMS Bounty</EM> Artifacts on a Day Trip from London to Greenwich, England,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2005<BR> </SPAN> <BR>Maritime buffs can enjoy an interesting day trip from London to the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site, which offers a number of attractions. Greenwich, literally the ""green village,"" contains crooked lanes, bric-a-brac shops and bustling antique and flea markets. HMAS (Her Majesty's Armed Ship) <I>Bounty</I> and Pitcairn Island enthusiasts will be drawn in particular to the National Maritime Museum (NMM) and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG).<BR><BR>The NMM (http:\\www.nmm.ac.uk) is a state-of-the-art facility with fascinating displays on Britain's maritime past, present and future. Founded in 1934, this is the world's largest nautical museum, with a collection of over two million items. Its 20 galleries display some of the finest objects, covering many aspects of ships, seafaring and marine affairs. The museum is housed in historic buildings which were formerly a school for the sons of seamen.<BR><BR>A number of artifacts from the <I>Bounty</I> are showcased in the Trade and Empire gallery, including a coconut shell, a horn cup and a small weight used to measure out portions of food. Presumably these instruments were used by William Bligh and his loyalists on their lengthy longboat voyage. A worm-eaten piece of wood from the <I>Bounty</I>'s rudder is displayed as are a corkscrew and a pipe said to have belonged to Bligh. A braided grey lock of mutineer John Adams' hair several inches long is also exhibited. Adjacent to that is John Adams' original grave marker from Pitcairn Island. John Adams was the last of the mutineers to die on Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific.<BR><BR>Although one of the museum's most fascinating <I>Bounty</I>-related items is not on display, it can be viewed easily upon application to the NMM's Caird Library. This library contains a copy of ""The Log of HMS Bounty 1787-1789"" by William Bligh. The volume in the museum is number 236 of a limited edition of 500 copies published in 1975 by Genesis Publications of Surrey, England. The book is a photographic reproduction of the original handwritten document which is held at the Public Records Office in Kew, England. Upon opening the <I>Bounty</I> log to page 248, visitors can read Bligh's own longhand account of the events of the mutiny on 28 April 1989. <BR><BR>Just across the park and up a small hill is the ROG (http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/navId/005000002002),<BR>which was founded in 1675 by King Charles II and designed by Sir Christopher Wren. The original purpose of the ROG was to provide accurate charts of the stars in order to improve navigation. Today this institution is the home of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees). <BR><BR>GMT, of course, is the basis of standard time throughout the world. The Shepherd gate clock at the ROG, installed in 1852 and still functioning, was the first public clock to display GMT. The ROG's red rooftop ball has dropped daily at precisely 1 p.m. since 1833. This used to assist mariners on the Thames to set their chronometers. <BR><BR>The prime meridian is the zero point which has been used in the calculation of terrestrial longitudes since 1884. Visitors may have their photographs taken at the meridian line while straddling two hemispheres. <BR><BR>On exhibit at the ROG are the four well-known marine timekeepers completed by John Harrison between 1735 and 1759. In addition, Larcum Kendall's second timekeeper is on display. This chronometer, known as K2, was built in 1771. A simplified and cheaper version of Harrison's H4 timekeeper, which itself dates to 1759, K2 was used by Captain Phipps on his Arctic voyage of discovery in 1773 and was later issued to William Bligh for use on the <I>Bounty</I>. <BR><BR>The Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site also includes some other places of general interest. The seventeenth-century Palladian Queen's House was England's first purely classical building. Designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 as a retreat for Anne of Denmark, queen to James I, the building was refurbished in 2001 and now provides well-lit galleries. The Queen's House contains the Tulip Stairs which date to 1635. This was Britain's first centrally unsupported spiral stairway.<BR><BR>The outstanding painted hall and chapel of the nearby Old Royal Naval College, originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1695 to house naval pensioners, are also open to the public. The buildings, which became the Royal Naval College in 1873, are said to be a Baroque masterpiece. <BR><BR>The hauntingly beautiful and much-visited <I>Cutty Sark</I>, launched in 1869 and the last of the China tea clipper ships, has been in dry dock at Greenwich Pier since 1954. Nearby, also in dry dock is <I>Gipsy Moth</I> IV, in which Sir Francis Chichester circumnavigated the world in 119 days in 1967. <BR><BR>Those who collect maritime history books will appreciate the existence of a nautical bookstore in Greenwich. Those not tempted by nautical books may enjoy browsing instead in one of Greenwich's four interesting bargain bookstores where every title is marked down to only Sterling 2.00. <BR><BR>Greenwich can be reached easily by riverboat in about an hour from Embankment Pier, Tower Millennium Pier, Waterloo Millennium Pier or Westminster Millennium Pier, all in central London. This has been called the best boat ride in London. Even Henry VIII arrived in Greenwich by boat on one of his hunting expeditions. Today visitors ride by the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the recently-developed Docklands area. Three miles downstream the Thames erupts into one of the most sublime sights of English architecture. Minutes later the masts and rigging of the <I>Cutty Sark</I> finally come into view. <BR><BR>And yet a day trip from London to Greenwich can be quite inexpensive. A round trip boat ticket is about Sterling 6.00 ($10.25). Or, for only Sterling 4.10 ($7.00), visitors to London may purchase a Day Travelcard valid for unlimited travel on the underground, buses and the modern Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in zones one and two. This pass may be purchased at certain main underground stations only after 9:30 a.m., and it is valid until 4:30 a.m. the following day. <BR><BR>More expensive versions of the Day Travelcard exist for those requiring travel in additional zones and/or travel on multiple days. The Travelcard is also sold at Heathrow Airport's tube stations after 9:30 a.m. Incidentally, holders of a Travelcard are entitled to one-third off the price of most riverboat services.<BR><BR>Visitors will find it convenient to change from the Jubilee Line of the underground to the DLR at Canary Wharf where only a short walk is required. It is best to alight from the DLR at the ""<I>Cutty Sark</I> for Maritime Greenwich"" station. Signs are posted to the various attractions in Greenwich. Admission is free to both the NMM and the ROG. Restaurants and sandwich shops in the compact area of maritime Greenwich enable visitors to spend an entire day there, including a lovely indoor lunch or a picnic outdoors in the park or near the pier. <BR><BR><BR><B>AUTHOR'S NOTE:<BR></B><BR>For nearly 40 years I have been fascinated by the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and by Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific where the mutineers fled. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read the Nordhoff and Hall <I>Bounty</I> Trilogy and then began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. Recently I realized that it would be very easy for me to view some of the original artifacts relating to the <I>Bounty</I> saga. After visiting Greenwich, England in July 2003 I wrote the short article above. <BR><BR>I realize that most other people will not have the same level of interest as I have in the <I>Bounty</I> and in Pitcairn Island. Nevertheless I hope that this article may stimulate others to realize that, similarly, it might not be so difficult for them to visit locations or museums which may hold original artifacts relating to a topic which may be of interest to them. <P><BR>Ted Cookson<BR> Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR> 5 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P>",260
34,23,"""Italy's Amalfi Coast,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2007 <BR><BR> </P><O:P><P >The Amalfi Coast on the southern part of the Sorrento Peninsula is one of the prettiest areas in Italy. The Amalfi Drive, hugging the coast of the Campania region along the Gulf of Salerno, has been called Italy's most romantic road. This narrow, winding cliff-hanging byway, in places carved right out of the side of the mountain, is a challenge to navigate. However, those traversing the Amalfi Drive are rewarded with spectacular views of small coves and of boats bobbing in the azure sea far below. Amalfi and Positano are the two most popular spots along the Amalfi Coast. </P><P >Amalfi, 61 km (38 miles) east of Sorrento and with a population of only 5,500, is the largest town on this coast. Dramatically situated at the mouth of a ravine under towering 1,315-meter (4,312-foot) Mt. Cerreto, the burg is sandwiched between tall cliffs and a rocky coastline broken occasionally by coves with sandy beaches. </P><P >Amalfi's rich history is not evident from what tourists see today. Incredibly, this small town was once the capital of the seafaring Republic of Amalfi, one of the great maritime powers. From the ninth to the eleventh century Amalfi rivaled Venice and Genoa for influence in the Mediterranean. </P><P >The first mention of Amalfi dates from the sixth century, and a circular maritime trade with the East developed soon thereafter. Grain, slaves, salt and timber were traded to Egypt and Syria for gold dinars. These coins were then paid to the Byzantines for silk which was in turn sold back in Europe. Independent from the seventh century until 1075, Amalfi reached the height of its power in about 1000 when it boasted a population of 70,000. Not only was the ship compass introduced to Europe in 1302 by Flavio Gioia, an Amalfi native, but Amalfi's maritime code was used in the Mediterranean until 1570. </P><P >Positano, a picturesque seaport of 3,900 lying 17 km (11 miles) west of Amalfi, was part of the maritime Republic of Amalfi in the tenth century. However, Positano's apogee came much later. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ships from Positano carried silk, spices and wood to the Middle East. The subsequent decline of Positano's prosperity coincided with the rise of steamships in the mid-nineteenth century. As much as three-quarters of the town's population of 8,000 immigrated to the United States, with the majority going to New York. Interestingly, one of the tough tasks that faced later mayors of Positano was finding enough burial plots for those very emigrees, many of whom wanted to be buried back in their birthplace. </P><P >Positano, little more than a sleepy fishing village in the early twentieth century, was discovered after World War II when American troops, stationed in nearby Salerno, began taking holidays there. In the 1950s writers such as John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams and painters such as Paul Klee were drawn to Positano. In the 1960s Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones composed the lyrics to their song Midnight Rambler while on holiday in Positano. The rest, as they say, is history. Today tourism is the major industry, and the town is simply besieged by Europeans and North Americans during the summer. Positano is now among Europe's most chic destinations. </P><P >Sorrento, on the Gulf of Naples, is the gateway to the Amalfi Coast. With a population of 17,000, Sorrento lies at the western end of the Amalfi Drive. It can be reached easily by train, bus, ferry or hydrofoil from Naples, only 50 km (30 miles) away, or by ferry or hydrofoil from the Isle of Capri. Local coastal ferries operate along the Amalfi Coast between Sorrento in the west and Salerno in the east. In summer there are also ferry and hydrofoil services between Amalfi, Positano and Capri and between Amalfi, Positano and Naples. </P></O:P></SPAN><O:P><P ><BR>Ted Cookson </P><P >Manager - Maadi </P><P >Egypt Panorama Tours </P><P >Cairo, Egypt<BR>1 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P><P > </P></O:P>",279
36,23,""" A Cruise to Greenland,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in August 2004<BR> <BR>Greenland is the largest island in the world. Although it has an area of 2.2 million square km, only 410,000 square km is not ice-covered. In fact, the Greenland ice sheet is the second largest in the world. The average ice thickness is 1,500 meters, and the ice sheet constitutes 10% of the world's fresh water. If Greenland's ice cap were to melt, sea level would rise by seven meters!<BR><BR>Greenland's first Stone Age inhabitants migrated from North America nearly 5,000 years ago. The Thule, who were closely related to the Inuit, arrived later in about 900 A. D., and Inuit migration continued until the late nineteenth century. Norse settlements were begun in 985 A. D. and lasted until the middle of the fifteenth century. European whalers visited Greenland from the sixteenth century onward, and a Norwegian priest settled there in 1721. Because the priest had received official Danish support for his expedition, his arrival ushered in a colonial era that lasted some two and a half centuries. A 1953 constitution granted Greenland home rule under Danish sovereignty. Essentially Greenland then became a province of Denmark. <BR><BR>Approximately 56,000 people live in Greenland. Of this total, some 49,000 were born there. Over 75% of the population lives in towns, of which Nuuk on Greenland's west coast is the largest. The central portion of western Greenland is the most densely populated. There 60% of the people swell in the six largest towns. The remainder live a rural existence in about 120 trading posts and sheep stations.<BR><BR>Sheep farming is practiced in the South. Fishing, however, is the major industry; and the cold-water prawn is the most important fishing product. Greenland halibut is also significant. Prawns constitute 64% of Greenland's exports. Halibut, crab and cod make up most of the remainder.<BR><BR>In August 2003 I sailed on Holland America Lines' MS Rotterdam from Rotterdam the New York City via Greenland. The Rotterdam sailed through beautiful Prins Christian Sund (Prince Christian Sound) and then called at the town of Qaqortoq on Greenland's southwest coast.<BR><BR>In southern Greenland there is a network of channels and fjords stretching 450 km. Prins Christian Sund, one of these channels, is navigable only from the middle of summer until late autumn. This remote area offers spectacular scenery. Glaciers, waterfalls, 1400-meter-high granite peaks and icebergs can all be seen. Prins Christian Sund is 58 km long and only 480 meters wide at its narrowest point. By comparison, the length of the Rotterdam is 237 meters.<BR><BR>Qaqortog, the largest town is southern Greenland with a population of 3,600, is situated in the area where Norsemen settled in the tenth century. Is is unclear why Norse settlement in Greenland failed by the fifteenth century. However, Norse ruins can still be seen today 15 km from town. Qaqortoq was founded in 1775 by a Norwegian trader. The town was originally named Junianehab after Danish Queen Juliana Marie. Julianehab became the largest trading post in southern Greenland, and it maintains that distinction today. The oldest standing house was built in 1797.<BR><BR>As is the case with all towns in Greenland, Qaqortoq has no road connections with any other city. Instead, the inhabitants of Qaqortoq use ferries and helicopters for public transportation. Because the harbor in Qaqortoq is small, the Rotterdam sat at anchor and passengers were taken ashore by the ship's tenders.<BR><BR>Qaqortoq is an academic center, with both a vocational school and a commercial college which, interestingly, offers a course in tourism. In addition, a nearby agricultural research station trains sheep farmers and operates an experimental farm.<BR><BR>It was interesting to walk in the center of Qaqortoq where several wooden and stone houses date back to the nineteenth century. A decade ago 18 Scandinavian sculptors created works of art on solid rock faces and on boulders lying around town. Today 24 sculptures exist. Too, Qaqortoq boasts Greenland's only fountain. Built in 1928, this sits in a town square. Finally, there is a small museum. <BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO GREENLAND:</P><P>Greenland can be reached by air from a number of cities, including: Baltimore, MD, USA; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Reykjavik, Iceland. In the summer cruise ships regularly call at ports in southern Greenland also.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",229
37,23,"""Greece's Corinth Canal,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in November 2007 </SPAN></P><P >On the afternoon of 24 May 2007 I was a passenger on the 208-passenger, 10,000-ton <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> when that vessel made a transit of the 3.9-mile (6.3-km)-long Corinth Canal from west to east. <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> is 439 feet (134 meters) long and 63 feet (19.2 meters) wide. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal connects the Gulf of Corinth with the Aegean Sea's Saronic Gulf. Cutting through the sandy alluvial soil of the Isthmus of Corinth, the canal separates the Peloponnesian peninsula from the Greek mainland. In effect, the canal creates an island out of the Peloponnesus. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal, only 68.9 feet (21 meters) wide and 26 feet (8 meters) deep, was constructed between 1881 and 1893. First the two ends were dug by a French firm. Then, after that company went bankrupt, a Greek contractor completed the work. The opening of the Corinth Canal a mere two dozen years after the opening of the Suez Canal helped to propel the Greek port of Piraeus into a major Mediterranean port. However, the expected windfall from canal tolls never materialized. In this age of supertankers, the Corinth Canal bears an anachronistic charm. <BR><BR>Because of the dangers faced by ancient mariners in their small boats, the idea of a canal across the narrow Ismthus of Corinth arose thousands of years ago. The first to attempt the construction of a canal was Periander, the seventh-century ruler of Corinth. Although Periander failed to dig much, he did improve upon the previous method of hauling small craft across the isthmus. That method involved pulling boats over large wooden rollers. Under Periander a stone trackway was built on which wheeled, flat vehicles could be used to pull boats. In fact, that system of portage remained in use until the twelfth century, and traces of the trackway can still be seen today near the canal's western end.<BR><BR>Roman Emperor Julius Caeser, who ruled from 48 to 44 B. C., also planned to build a canal across the Isthmus of Corinth. However, Caesar, of course, was assassinated. Later, in 54-68 A. D., the infamous Roman Emperor Nero actually participated in a ground-breaking ceremony for a canal using a golden pick, and six thousand Judean slaves began the excavation. But Nero, too, died shortly thereafter and the project was then abandoned until the late nineteenth century.<BR><BR>Small ships coming from the Western Mediterranean or from the Adriatic which are bound for the Eastern Mediterranean or the Black Sea find the Corinth Canal useful. Although ships narrow enough to utilize the canal can shave 248 miles (400 kilometers) off their journey, most of the 12,000 annual canal transits are now made for touristic purposes. Interestingly, the ships transiting the canal hail from more than 50 different countries.<BR> <BR>Two sightseeing options are available to those not able to sail on a cruise ship through the Corinth Canal. The canal can be viewed safely from the sidewalk of a highway bridge over the canal within a short distance of the town of Corinth.

41,23,"""The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in July 2005<BR> <BR>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, opened in </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> , </SPAN> Spain</SPAN> in 1997. This institution, now an icon for </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN>'s progress, helped to spur a cultural renaissance and surge in tourism to the city. <BR><BR>Although the museum's impressive collection includes a broad spectrum of modern and contemporary art, it is the innovative building itself which is the city's stunning architectural jewel. Centered around an atrium that is 164 feet (50 meters) high are 19 galleries plus an auditorium, a restaurant and offices. The museum's floor area is 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters), nearly half of which is exhibition space. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao also includes the world's largest exhibition hall, some 422 feet (130 meters) long. <BR><BR>Architect Frank Gehry was faced with some difficult design problems. On one side of the museum site in central </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> is the </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Nervion</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>River</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> ; on this side the site is 52 feet (16 meters) below the level of the rest of the city. On another end is a bridge which serves as one of the city's major access routes. Yet Gehry managed to overcome these issues successfully, integrating his avant garde building into the city's urban fabric. <BR><BR>The museum building is an unorthodox combination of connected shapes. The beautiful titanium exterior panels, 0.2 inch (0.5 mm) thick, give the surface a certain tactile feel. It has even been said that this extraordinary building constitutes a novel form of architecture! <BR><BR></SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> is </SPAN> Spain</SPAN>'s fourth largest city; its metropolitan area contains roughly half of northern </SPAN> Spain</SPAN>'s Basque population. </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> has served as the industrial and financial center of the Basque homeland since the mid-nineteenth century.

44,23,"HOW TO GET TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P>British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is most easily reached by yacht charter from the Maldives. However, some travelers have also sailed to BIOT by yacht charter from the Seychelles. The sailing time to BIOT from Seychelles is substantially longer than what is required from Gan (Addu Atoll) in the Maldives. </P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P >""A Travelers Century Club Expedition to Remote British Indian Ocean Territory,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2002<BR> <BR>Membership in the Travelers Century Club (TCC), organized in Los Angeles in 1954 by a group of the worlds most widely traveled people, is limited to those who have visited 100 or more of the 317 destinations on the clubs list.<BR><BR>One of the most remote of those destinations is British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Formerly called the Oil Islands (oil refers to copra, or coconut oil, rather than to petroleum), BIOT consists of the Chagos Archipelago. Lying south of the Republic of the Maldives, BIOT consists of a number of atolls, the most southerly and the best known of which is Diego Garcia, where some of the U. S. aircraft employed in Afghanistan were based. In the northern reaches of BIOT are the Salomon Islands, which I visited by yacht 21-22 July 2002.<BR><BR>Our yacht charter was organized by club member Charles Veley who was attempting to visit the entire TCC list within a period of 15 months. Charles, in his mid-30s, also planned to be the youngest person to visit every destination on the TCC list. Charles had already found two others to share the steep yacht charter expenses, Jeff Shea and Ben Fogle. Jeff is another TCC member who is also an accomplished mountain climber. Ben Fogle, while not a TCC member, is a BBC travel show presenter who is writing a book on far-flung British overseas territories. (There may also eventually be a parallel BBC television program.)<BR><BR>On 17 July I flew Emirates from Cairo to the Maldives via Dubai. Upon arrival on the morning of 18 July I hopped a motorized ferry from the airport island across to Male, the capital, which is situated on a nearby island. Then early on the morning of 19 July we flew to Gan in a 15-passenger twin engine plane. <BR><BR>Upon arrival at Gan the four of us were met by two sedan cars which carried us a short distance to a spot where we could board a small motorboat to go out to our 94-foot sailing yacht, the Dream Voyager. Due to the peculiar geography of the Maldives, which consists of many small atolls, cars are rather uncommon. But during the British presence at Gan between 1957 and 1976 some 10 miles of road had been built at Addu Atoll by joining together several adjacent islands with causeways.<BR><BR>After customs clearance we finally set sail on the evening of 19 July in Dream Voyager south from Addu Atoll en route to the Salomon Islands in BIOT. We were sailing against a strong southeasterly wind, and the water was choppy. Although I was wearing an ear patch, I didn't feel like eating much for dinner. But I definitely felt better after losing lunch later that evening.<BR><BR>Our accommodations on the air-conditioned Dream Voyager were excellent. Each of us had his own bedroom with private sink, shower and toilet. The yacht carried a crew of eight, including an international captain. Due to Maldives maritime regulations, one captain had been required for the domestic journey from Male, from where the yacht had originally sailed with crew only; and we required a second captain for our international journey which began at Gan.<BR><BR>We sailed south all day on 20 July. Then on the morning of 21 July land was sighted. We could see the low-lying Salomon Islands atoll on the horizon. All of the islands are covered with a dense forest of coconut palms. About two hours later we sailed into the horseshoe-shaped atoll which opens to the north. We then turned right and dropped anchor off Boddam Island, one of ten islands in the atoll. The crossing had taken us about 40 hours.<BR><BR>The atolls of what is now BIOT used to fall under the political control of Mauritius. Then in the early 1970s the various islands were sterilized. The people living on Boddam Island and on other atolls in the Chagos Archipelago - about 2,000 in total - were ""compensated"" and shipped off to Mauritius. I heard that the dogs living on one of the islands were all gassed. BIOT was declared to be an independent political entity in 1972. The sterilization procedures apparently fulfilled the terms of an agreement under which the U. S. in 1972 took over Diego Garcia from the U. K. on a long-term lease. The British coast guard still patrols the waters of BIOT, and U. S. military personnel occupy only the large atoll of Diego Garcia with its air base in the far south.<BR><BR>The ""Ilois,"" people who had been removed from the Chagos Archipelago, recently won a court case against the U. K. This court decision will allow them to return to their former homes on Boddam Island and elsewhere in BIOT. We heard that a boat carrying a few of these islanders would soon be arriving in the Salomon Islands in order to check out the current situation there.<BR><BR>We landed on a pristine sandy beach on the northeast side of the still uninhabited Boddam Island on the morning of 21 July. Before I left Cairo I had commissioned the painting of a cloth banner which read, ""Travelers Century Club - BIOT 2002."" After taking photos of ourselves holding that banner, we began to explore, traversing the width of the island on a well-marked path. The western side of Boddam - without the protection of the atoll - offered rougher water and a much narrower beach with both sand and rocks.<BR><BR>Boddam Island contains the remains of a copra plantation. The old warehouse is connected to the dock bynarrow gauge railway tracks. The cement and coral walls of the buildings remain but some of the roofs have decayed. One of the old building stones bore the inscription, ""Cowen - England."" There is also a graveyard where headstones bear inscriptions dating back to the 1800s.<BR><BR>There are a church and a number of residential buildings. The latter, made of corrugated metal, still stand with their roofs intact. The interiors of some of the buildings have been spray painted with the names of yachts and yachters who have visited in recent years. One such yachter graffito, for instance, reads, ""Against all odds - Andy & Margaux, Australia 2001 - Love to live, live to love.""<BR><BR>We overnighted off Boddam Island along with a dozen or so other yachts which were anchored in the Salomons. This atoll serves as a way station for yachts crossing the Indian Ocean. For a $70 fee yachts are allowed to anchor for several months. Having chatted with a few of the yachters on Boddam, we learned that some yachters sail to BIOT, stay up to six months, and then simply return again after resupplying in Malaysia or Thailand. With E-mail available nowadays via short wave, yachters can easily stay in touch with the outside world even from somewhere as remote as BIOT.<BR><BR>Yachters sometimes congregate on Boddam Island in the evening in order to barbecue and socialize, and perhaps once a month the British coast guard sponsors a barbecue for all yachters present. There is a volleyball court, a swing made from rope and a half of a coconut shell and even a picnic table.<BR><BR>Although fishing is allowed in BIOT, diving is not. Regulations are enforced by and yacht fees are collected by the British coast guard which calls in at the Salomon Islands from time to time. We felt fortunate that Andy, a coast guard official, called on us the morning of 22 July because he stamped our passports!<BR><BR>Andy clearly was not looking for trouble when he boarded our yacht. He commented that, if we had any dive tanks on board, he didn't want to see them. I believe that anyone who had dived in the Salomon Islands would have said that it was the most fantastic dive he had ever taken since the water was so very clear.<BR><BR>After disembarking from our yacht, Andy returned to his coast guard vessel and sailed out of the Salomon Islands atoll in search of commercial vessels fishing in BIOT waters. He was also charged with inspecting these vessels.<BR><BR>On the afternoon of 22 July we rode our yacht's small motorboat from our anchorage near Boddam Island around the rest of the atoll. After landing on Takamaka Island we saw a ray swimming in the crystal clear water. Before returning to our own yacht across the lagoon, we halted to swim and snorkel at the site where another yacht had recently sunk. The sunken yacht's two white masts rose at an awkward angle out of the blue green waters of the Salomon Islands lagoon. We could see that a PC and other personal belongings were still aboard the sunken yacht, which bore a hole in its fiberglass hull.<BR><BR>Arriving back on the Dream Voyager, we found a Frenchman and his daughter from another yacht on board our own yacht sipping tea with our crew. They related to us the story of the sinking of the yacht in the lagoon two weeks previously. The family which owned it was then still in the lagoon, living aboard another boat with some friends. <BR><BR>The prevailing southeasterly wind assisted us on our northbound journey from the Salomon Islands in BIOT to Addu Atoll in the Maldives, so the return sailing took only about 38 hours. Upon arrival at Gan on the morning of 24 July, Maldives immigr",450

50,23,"<body><p class=""MsoNormal"">""<b>Reunion Island, Secret of the Indian Ocean</b>,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2009 <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Reunion, an overseas department of France, is situated some 800 km (500 miles) east of Madagascar and 200 km (130 miles) southwest of Mauritius.  With a length of 63 km (39 miles), a width of 45 km (28 miles) wide, and an area of 2,512 square km (970 square miles), Reunion was visited by the Portuguese in 1635 and then first occupied by the French from 1642 to 1649.  Although under British control from 1810 to 1815, immigration from France over the succeeding two centuries plus immigration of Africans, Indians, Chinese and Malays has given rise to a mix of ethnicities on the island.      <br><br>My last visit to Reunion was by cruise ship in April 2008.  I had reserved a Hertz rental van which the firm had agreed via email to deliver at the port.  Although Hertz kept reassuring me by phone that the van was on the way and would arrive shortly, after an hour and 45 minutes of waiting I finally gave up and hired a taxi van for 200 euros to take our party of six on a six-hour circular drive around the beautiful verdant island.  <br><br>From the port at La Possession on Reunion&apos;s west coast we drove past the many beach resorts which stretch south from St. Paul 45 km (28 miles) to St. Louis.  The best sandy beaches are on the west coast of the island.  Although we didn&apos;t have time that day to make the side trip from St. Louis into the center of the island to view Cirque de Cilaos, luckily I had done that on a previous visit.  Reunion boasts three cirques, which are spectacular calderas in the interior of the island formed long ago by collapsing underground lava chambers.  Eventually deep canyons were eroded from these amphitheaters out to the sea.  The roads into the cirques wind through these canyons up to grand vistas of volcanic peaks and forested ravines.  The 37-km (22-mile) road from the coast at St. Louis up to Cilaos boasts over 400 bends.  Cilaos, situated at a height of 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) and with a population of 6,000, was developed as a spa in the late nineteenth century.  On 15-16 March 1952 1,870 mm (73.6 inches) of rainfall fell at Cilaos.  This is the world record for the most rainfall ever recorded in a 24-hour period!  Tourists with enough time should attempt to view or visit all three of Reunion&apos;s cirques. <br><br>From St. Pierre south of St. Louis we headed inland, driving up to Reunion&apos;s High Plains which lie at about 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) and which separate the island&apos;s cirques from its volcano.  As we climbed, the temperature became much more comfortable.  The highlight of our day trip to Reunion was the lunar-like crater of Piton de la Fournaise, one of the world&apos;s most active and yet most accessible volcanos.  This shield volcano has erupted more than 100 times since 1640.  The lava flow from Piton de la Fournaise is roughly three million cubic meters (about 4 million cubic yards) per day!   Piton de la Fournaise is similar to the volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii in that they are all located above hot spots in the earth&apos;s crust.<br><br>Following our visit to the volcano, we stopped at the Nez de Boeuf viewpoint over the spectacular canyon of the Riviere des Remparts.  A popular ten-hour walk leads from this point down the steep cliff and onward by trail through a national forest to the town of St. Joseph on the south coast.  Then, after crossing through Reunion&apos;s interior, we descended to St. Benoit on the island&apos;s east coast and then continued north to the capital of St. Denis.  Founded in 1668, St. Denis was named for a ship which had sunk there.  With a population of 140,000, St. Denis, constructed on a grid pattern along the north coast, has a few buildings  interesting for their architecture as well as a pretty seaside park.<br><br>Although the population of Reunion is over 800,000, about half of the inhabitants actually live in France.  Nevertheless, interestingly, there are some 340,000 automobiles on Reunion!  Needless to say, the road system is excellent, and there is a motorway which wraps around a fair amount of the island&apos;s coastline.<br><br>Reunion is not usually thought of as a dive destination.  However, the island&apos;s west coast boasts some colorful and even stunning diving sites offering a wide array of tropical fish.  In October and November pelagic species such as barracuda and tuna are also in evidence.  The Indian Ocean waters surrounding Reunion are warmest (28 C./82 F.) between October and April.  At the other extreme, water temperatures drop to 21 C./70 F. in August.  Divers will want to avoid the height of the cyclone season, which is in February and March.  (Cyclones may arise anytime from December through March.)  Reunion&apos;s hot and rainy summer stretches from December until April while the cool and dry winter lasts from the end of April until October.  Reunion attracts the most tourists from late June until early September but there are also tourists aplenty from October until early January. <span style=""color: black""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 12.0pt""> </p>  <span

I highly recommend this wonderful, but undertouristed, destination.  ",57
6,22488,"<p>Where In the World? Tuesday, July 17, 2012 Partly named after an indigenous cactus, this British overseas territory has jet-setters flocking hither to enjoy one of the finest beaches in all the West Indies and world class diving on coral reefs reaching depths of more than 7,000 feet. Before the jets and as recently as the first hotel opening in 1968, many of the &quot;belongers&rdquo;&nbsp;traced their arrival back to a Spanish slave ship that wrecked ashore in 1844. Traffic was virtually non existent, there being only three vehicles on the island, one of them a bulldozer. It was in one of these other vehicles that Suzie, a newly transplanted hotel manager from New York, would pick up guests from the airport, lining up her headlights with the runway to facilitate approach during night time landings. Today as you make your way into town you might spot a street named &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;&nbsp;and you might just wonder about Suzie and about days long since departed. This extended weekend, in part celebration of the birth of the much beloved Anja Regina and part escape from New York&#39;s urban inferno, I will file this country, this &quot;magic monotony of existence between sky and water&quot; where &quot;aging is optional&rdquo;, #80 under &quot;T&rdquo;&nbsp;between Turkey and Uruguay. - A few days later - By the time you read this I will be high and dry some 30,000 feet over the Bahamas enroute to Atlanta with the fine white powdery beaches of the Providenciales fading quickly in the turquoise waters. It was early Sunday morning when I made my way to the remote and secluded North West Point passing locals dressed in their finest on the way to church services, the tourists still bedridden, recovering from a bout of rum poisoning the night before. I drove several miles along a desolate, rocky dirt road past shrubs and salt ponds over the highest hill until finally reaching Malcom beach. It was here in this bay that Christopher Columbus set anchor and explored the area many, many years ago. I thought I had the entire beach park to myself but spotted a flurry of activity further down near the exclusive Amanyara Resort. Upon closer inspection I found out it&rsquo;s a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret swimsuit photo shoot(they also shot here the year before). I made my into the water to find what other wonderful surprises the reefs might offer. The waters were teaming with fish, and I spotted a Barracuda, with a nice set of sharp teeth, just 10 feet away. As in Hawaii there are public access ways to all the beaches even among the big resorts, however being a British Overseas Territory, the beach up to the high water mark is not owned by the people but rather by, ahem, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. I found &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;, she now has an entire shopping plaza named after her, and made my way down to the marina where the original hotel, the Turtle Cove Inn, is still accepting guests. Gentle turquoise waters, friendly English speaking locals, reefs full of a diverse aquatic life, and powdery white beaches as soft as cotton candy teaming with supermodels, the Turks and Caicos certainly is &ldquo;beautiful by nature&quot;.</p>

 I saw the second largest(total mass) building in the world, the first being the Pentagon. I stumbled upon it as I had no travel guide to Romania or Bucharest and no idea what to see or where to go after arriving at the train station from Bulgaria.  Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, wanted it to be the biggest but just as it was nearing completeion in 1989 the wall came down and he had to escape the mob from the top of the palace by helicopter. He was later caught and executed along with his wife by firing squad on Christmas Day.",306
1,8018,"Rome, the Eternal City, a center of religion, history and culture.  In December, 2006, we spent 4 wonderful days in Rome.  Although we had been to Rome before on a short visit, this was the first chance where we could really spend some time, wander the streets and take a leisurely visit to many of the famous places.  We stayed in at the Hotel Settembre 95, a small boutique hotel located within a reasonable walk to many of the sites in Rome.  And walk we did.  While we saw much, we feel like we didn't even scratch the surface.  We could have spent weeks and still not take it all in.  Each day, we centered our explorations around a particular area.  One day we did historic Rome and Palantine Hill, on another, the Vatican area, on another the downtown, and on the last day we ventured outside Rome down the old Appian way. <br>Our first day, we spent time exploring the historical ancient Rome.  Surrounded by such antiquity and beauty, we allowed ourselves to get lost in the life of the ancient Etruscans and Romans.  Visiting such sites as the Coliseum, Palantine Hill, the Forum, and countless temples, statues, arches and monuments, we learned much about the history of this fascinating city.  The Michelin Green guide was an invaluable tool for us and for anyone who travels and is interested in the history and culture of an area.<br>The next day, we took the bus across the river to the land of the ""Holy See"", but I will cover that in that report.<br>The third day, was reserved for visiting the more modern center of the city and for shopping.  Wandering the Via Veneto, Quirinale, Castro Pretorio, Repubblica, and Trevi neighborhoods we visited an outdoor Christmas market at Piazza Navona along with many shops and small churches..  We bought some Christmas presents as well as ogled over all of the expensive designer items available in such abundance.  We also found time to just sit and relax, at a sidewalk cafe, as well as on the famous Spanish Steps, talking, and watching the throngs of interesting people pass us by.<br>On our final day we decided to venture outside the city, taking a bus and visiting the ancient Christian Catacombs and the old aqueduct along the Via Appia Antica (the Appian Way).  A very interesting and worthwhile trip.  Not only did we learn alot about ancient Christian history, but also enjoyed a nice jaunt down a very historical road.<br>Oh yes, one more thing.  We made sure to throw a coin over our shoulder into Trevi Fountain.  That way, according to legend, we will be assured that we will be returning to this magical city.<br>",891
5,8018,"Corsica, a rocky island south of France in the Ligurian Sea, is a land known for its independent spirit, rugged beauty, olive oil, citrus fruits and of course as the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Our first glimpse of Corsica revealed a rugged island, with jagged craggy mountains and snow capped peaks.  Yes, snow, even in July, snow could be seen in the uppermost mountains.  Calvi, Corsica was one of the ports we stopped at during a sailing trip on the Star Clipper from Cannes, France to Dubrovnik, Croatia in July of 2006. <br>Approaching Calvi, your eyes are immediately drawn to the most dominant feature in the town -  the citadel.   The citadel is a walled portion of the town which juts into the bay creating a very medieval look to the town.   Legend says that Christopher Columbus was born in Calvi (although most historians disagree) as can be seen in a monument at the approach to the citadel in town.   <br>We anchored in the harbor, and before we decided to go into town, Michael went Scuba Diving off of the walls of the citadel  where the remains of an American B17 bomber lies about 85-90 feet (25-28 meters) below the surface.  The bomber was mostly intact except for it's tail section.  In 1944, the B17 G ""Baron"" was on a mission in Italy. Unfortunately, German fighters hit the Baron. Without any radio, the pilot, Frank Chaplick, flew to Calvi (Corsica, France). The landing strip was too short, so he decided to land on the sea. <br>At lunch time, we took the tender into Calvi.  Starting off the afternoon, we ate a marvelous lunch in one of the many restaurants situated on the marina.  The marina, is a palm lined harbor on the waterfront with hoards of umbrella covered restaurant tables which of course feature French and Italian food, but with a Mediterranean flare.  After lunch we set off to explore the town. <br>We wandered the lower part of the town, looking through shops, parks and the like before deciding to set our sites upward.   To explore the citadel, we entered by way of Place Cristophe Colomb, named of course for that intrepid explorer.  It was hot, but we continued to wind our way around the walls taking in many of the breathtaking views of the town and harbor.  This was made much more fun in that the town within the citadel walls is not filled with tourist shops.  In fact you can only find a few shops and restaurants in the citadel.  The rest of the buildings include homes, the Governor's Palace, a couple of churches and loads of narrow, winding, empty streets.   We were amazed to find that the old town was peaceful and quiet, even in July, the height of tourist season.  At the top of the citadel you will find the Cathedral Saint-Jean Baptiste, a 13th century church (destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1570) where you can rest and pray for a few moments before descending back to the town. <br>After some wandering and shopping, we returned to the ship, having spent a peaceful day (although it was quite hot) in a sleepy little town called Calvi.  We would love to return to Corsica and explore it someday.  Perhaps it will be sooner than we think since some of our good friends are from Corsica and often spend summers back in their homeland.",251
0,10544,"Highlights: Lecce (a Baroque confection), Alberobello (where you can see the conical-roofed trulli), Locorotonda (the pale local sandstone gives the old town a lovely glow), Gallipoli (go before noon to the fishermen mend their nets all around the harbor), Squinzano (a small town with a lovely main square where a faded image of Mussolini still appears on one of the buildings) the Negroamaro wines, Trani (a gorgeous port with an austerely beautiful cathedral, fishing and pleasure boats in the capacious harbor, and a spectacular public garden by the sea), and of course the very unique Castel del Monte.

Less interesting: Bari, the capital. While I met many warm and friendly residents, Bari is still pretty gritty place and Bari\'s Centro Storico is to be avoided during siesta when the shops are closed.  I was mugged at 3 in the afternoon; fortunately, the thief was unarmed (and ultimately unsuccessful, but not without a fight.)",893

1,35,"First of all, I like traveling to any place where they speak Portugese, which in my opinion is the most beautiful language in the world.  My wife and I visited Portugal and the Azores in October 2005 and had a blast!  Lisbon is one of the great capitals of Europe.  The views from Lisbon's many hills are breathtaking although I must say I was a little put off by all of the graffitti.  We also visited the quaint village of Sintra, the amazing walled Renaissance town of Evora and the stunning Algarve coast in Southern Portugal.  Highlights included the delicious food and drink I had throughout Portugal including the interestingly paired, but incredibly tasty pork and clams, sardinhas asados, arroz con mariscos, vinho verde and of course Portugal's most famous wine . . . Port!  We also had an amazing time hiking up a mountain to Sintra's Palace and Moorish Castle and wandering the cobblestoned streets of Evora.  Finally, we relaxed on the sun-drenched beaches and coves of the Algarve . . . which to me evoked images of both the brilliant red-rock Bryce Canyon and the azure waters of the Mediterranean.  We explored the beautiful Algarve from our base in Lagos and while there, made it out to Cabo Sao Vicente (the most southwestern point of Europe).  One day I plan to return to Portugal and head north from Lisbon to Obidos, Coimbra and the famous Duoro Valley.",305
3,35,"I was in Copenhagen for a few days in July 1999 on my summer backpacking trip through Europe. We arrived by train from Amsterdam after being booted off in the middle of the night in Hamburg along with two dozen other people who, like us, did not know they needed a reservation for the Hamburg - Copenhagen segment. Strangely, many of those uninformed individuals were the same folks who were in the same Amsterdam ""Coffehouse"" as we were before boarding the train. Anyway, we did manage to catch another train from Hamburg later that next morning. My most vivid memory of Denmark is that Danish women are gorgeous!!! </p>",258
9,35,"The Society Islands are 1 of 5 island groups that make up French Polynesia and home to its capital, Papetee on the island of Tahiti.  As a child, I dreamed of visiting Bora Bora, which I would regularly hear dubbed on tv programs as the ""Most Beautiful Island in the World.""  My wife and I, therefore, decided to honeymoon in French Polynesia in May/June 2004.  We started in Bora Bora, then hopped over to Moorea before ending our romantic island adventures on Rangiroa in the Tuamotus.  Although Bora Bora is a very popular tourist destination these days, it is still drop-dead gorgeous.  Because it was our honeyomoon, we decided to splurge and stay in an overwater bungalow at the Pearl Resort.  All I can say is ""WOW!""  It doesn&apos;t get any better than having your own sun deck hanging off your hotel room with a ladder down into a crystal clear lagoon.  You could even feed the tropical fish that swam beneath your bungalow by removing the glass off of your coffee table.  Days were spent snorkeling in Bora Bora&apos;s warm translucent waters, paddling by canoe to one of Bora Bora&apos;s many motus, feeding ferocious sharks, or just taking in the scenery from the deck of our bungalow.  Nights were spent feasting on fresh seafood, including poisson cru (raw tuna in coconut milk and lime juice), and lying underneath the Tahitian moon again from the deck of our bungalow.  We even had a breakfast of fresh tropical fruits and croissants canoed right up to our bungalow one morning!  After Bora Bora, it was on to Moorea.  Although Moorea does not have nearly as beautiful of a lagoon as Bora Bora, it does have towering jungle-covered peaks.  We circumnavigated the entire island of Moorea by car one day and nearly biked around half of the island another day.  Shark feeding was especially spectacular on Moorea.  To make our connection from Moorea to Rangiroa, we had to fly back to Tahiti.  One thing that I always like to tell people about my 8 minute flight from Moorea to Tahiti is that we landed at our destination before we were even scheduled to take off!  It&apos;s true and pretty weird when you say it like that, but because all the passengers had checked in about 30 minutes before our scheduled take-off, they decided to board us and take off early, thus allowing us to arrive before our scheduled departure!",66
12,35,"My wife and I vistited the BVI during a two week trip through the Caribbean.  We stayed in Tortola for 3 nights and using that as our base traveled to St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to Virgin Gorda.  In my opinion, Virgin Gorda is the most beautiful island in the BVI, but I haven&apos;t been to Anageda or Jost Van Dyke, so my opinion might change one day after visiting those two islands.  While on Virgin Gorda, we explored the world-famous Baths; large rock out-croppings on Virgin Gorda&apos;s south shore that look somewhat similar to the granite rocks you see on some Seychelles&apos; beaches.  We also rented our own little schooner to explore Virgin Gorda&apos;s gorgeous, multi-colored North Sound.  The North Sound is dotted with picture-perfect islands and coral reefs.  Two islands that we stopped on were Saba Rock (not to be confused with Saba in the Netherlands Antilles) to grab a bite to eat and Eustatia Island (also not to be confused with St. Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles) to swim in it&apos;s warm off-shore waters.  Our time in paradise was unfortunately dampered by me losing my wedding ring while hopping in and out of our schooner in the North Sound and then several days later when I left our camera on our LIAT flight down to Grenada.  While I was able to replace my wedding ring, I lost forever my pictures of the British Virgin Islands. . . I guess I&apos;ll have to go back one day to take some more pictures!",220
16,35,"My wife and I honeymooned in French Polynesia in May and June of 2004. After enjoying the islands of Bora Bora and Moorea in the Society Islands, we flew over to Rangiroa in the Tuamotus for a few days. Rangiroa was spectacular! We stayed at the Kia Ora which was expensive, but worth the splurge for a honeymoon. If you visit Rangiroa, the two things that you must do is visit the Blue Lagoon and shoot the pass via a drift snorkel. The Blue Lagoon is a smaller lagoon enclosed within Rangiroa&apos;s larger lagoon. I often refer to my trip to the Blue Lagoon as the best day of my life. The weather could not have been more beautiful. Our two Polynesian guides could not have been nicer and the scenery could not have been more impressive. The Blue Lagoon is the epitome of paradise!!! Its shallow waters were swarming with small black-tipped sharks that I fed fish guts to. You could swim from one little motu (island) to the next through crystal clear waters. Our guides prepared us (and the only other couple who accompanied us on our trip) a scruptious beach BBQ which included some of the best fish and potato salad I have ever tasted. On our trip back to the Kia Ora across Rangiroa&apos;s huge lagoon, we spotted a manta ray and a tiger shark. We also went for a snorkel at a little island smack dab in the middle of Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon where we were treated to some sea turtles. The next day, we shot the pass (we drift snorkeled through one of the two passes that connect Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon to the ocean). The current is so strong that you don&apos;t even need to swim. . .you are just carried by the current into the lagoon. It was by far the best snorkel of my life. Visibility was probably at 200 feet plus. The bottom of the pass had somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 large grey sharks (that was the approximate count made by our guide). Towards the end of our snorkel, we passed over a plateau where the ocean floor came within 10 meters of us. Never in my life had I witnessed so many colors all in one place. There were thousands upon thousands of fish of all diffferent sizes and shades. My wife and I were blown away by what we were looking at! Rangiroa was one of the highlights of all my travels and I hope that one day, I&apos;ll have the chance to visit it again and also visit some of its Tuamotu neighbors including Fakarava and Manihi. </p>",75

Plus, the Azores make some of the best cheese I&apos;ve ever tasted often accompanied with this spicy red chili sauce.

There were some commercial containers as well.
   Ascension Island doesn\'t have a dock for cargo or ocean going ships. We anchored a mile or so off of Georgetown and motorized barges came alongside during daylight hours and our ship\'s cranes discharged two containers onto each barge. Ascension Island had experienced a large storm right before we arrived so there was a large ocean swell that made the discharge more challenging and dangerous.
   After receiving its quota of 2 boxes the barge would go to the shore where a shore-based crane would lift the boxes off the barge and put them on a truck to bring them to their destination. Later after the containers were emptied of their contents they were brought back to the ship for return to the US.",221

Actually, my only experience in doing so before  had been in Trinidad and Tobago several years earlier.  

We drove first to Cambridge, where we visited my cousin, Alan Wheeler, who was a student at Cambridge University at the time.  It was a great place to sleep off our jet lag, and then have a \""local\"" show us around for a couple of days.  A highlight was punting on the Cam.  I never knew until then that Cambridge was named for the bridge which crosses the Cam River there.

We chose not to make advance reservations for lodging, and were fortunate to be able to find reasonable rooms wherever we went.  We had overnight visits to York and Bath, especially enjoying the historical sites in those cities.  We then ventured north into Scotland, then on to Wales where we stayed in a medieval castle, but I will say more about those on the appropriate pages.  

A side trip to Stonehenge was a must see on our bucket list.  Then It was back to London to take in the sights of that City we had missed earlier.  It happened to be the same time as the queen mum\'s funeral, and also the London Marathon, so London was crowded with visitors.  Of the many sights we saw (Big Ben, Westminster Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, and much more), I was especially determined to see the Tower of London.  As fate would have it, we found ourselves standing on a  corner across from the Tower, and the street was blocked by the Marathon which was in progress.  We watched for an opening between the runners for several minutes, then finally made our dash across the closed street.  As we did, a policeman yelled at us to go back, saying \""These people have waiting all year for this race, you\'ll have to come back tomorrow.\""  I grabbed my wife\'s hand and kept running while I yelled back, \""I\'ve waited 54 years to see the Tower of London, and today is my only chance.\""  I don\'t know what the onlookers thought of us rude Americans, but we loved our visit to their awesome city.",260

He took me to Lloyd\'s Guest House and Beach Apartments, located on Crocus Hill and a short walk from the very beautiful Crocus Bay.  Price for the room included meals, served family style around a big table.  One of the most enjoyable factors in my stay in Anguilla was chatting around the table with the eclectic assortment of other guests who were from various places around the world.

No one in Greenland can own land so if some one had a house they had no front or back yard; there were also many ghetto style block buildings five floors high in the center of town, but yet the town as a whole was colorful, the roads were bad and it was quite dirty but great views of mountains every where, great scenery of the beautiful Nuuk fiord which is one of the largest fiords in Greenland, where you could see wild seals and icebergs floating by and the whole town was surrounded by water. Like Iceland it was never dark here, I think sunset was around midnight and 30 minutes later it was sunrise. I would say I was there about four hours when I was invited to some ones house for tea the host wanted to practice his English on me, he said he did not speak English for eight years or so, it was a big deal for his family to have me visit their home, they lived in those blocked buildings, there I tried some dried aged Polar bear meat. I could live with out it. Even thou the surroundings looked poor and Greenland is considered a third world country, lots of people were out of work and there is here a bit of a local drinking problem the prices were similar to Iceland, unbelievable. I had a few contacts here before arriving here, so I quickly got in touch with them and made some new friends here. We would hang out together; walk around together, party together, and go boating together;I really just had a peaceful good time here, spending time with them. After that I was staying in some ones home out in no mans land just enjoying the simple life, of walking around and climbing mountains and enjoying the nature. No stress and no schedule.",229
9,2701,"A, B, C islands, well that is what the Dutch call them. Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, there are also three moreDutch islands in the Caribbean and they are called theS Islands and they are, Saba, St. Eustatius and St.Maarten so all together the Dutch control six islandsin the Caribbean.I have been to the first three islands, I started withCuracao.The first difference I noticed here is that I don&apos;tget to use my Spanish so much, and off course it ispossible for me to find reasonable accommodationshere. I stayed in Willemstad, that is the capital andI stayed on the Otrabanda side of Willemstad. Thecapital has two sides with the sea in between and youget to cross from side to side by a free ferry thatleaves every few minutes and takes about five minutesto get you across to the other side.On the other side which was called Punda it had theoldest Synagogue in the western hemisphere. I wentthere for Passover service but had the dinner at theRabbis house of another Synagogue. The Capital is full of color, I mean the buildings areso colorful, that you can take a 100 pictures andstill want to take more.Here I would walk around every day. Also I sat at acafe and eat. Went out at night which was most of thetime, very quite there. You see otrabanda and Punda the other side ofWillemstad are mostly for tourist, so the locals goout mostly to bars or cafes inland. I went there too,but not my cup of tea. I guess its the people.I also checked out a beach or two but that was it.Since I travel with one way air tickets to get fromone island to another, I went with this small airlinecompany, that has small airplanes that holds ninepassengers, four rows with two passengers on each rowand one person must sit by the pilot either side ofhim, because both sides have the wheel and all of thecontrols, yes, you can guess where I sat? And once thepilot got the airplane up in the air guess who tookthe wheel and announced to the other passengers thatthe Co Pilot is now flying the plane? You are rightboth times.Bonaire, was my second stop and it is the smallest ofthe three islands. Here I was lucky enough to meet awomen who picked me up after watching a small paradethat they had in Rincon which was the town where theslaves use to live in the past and after talking withher a bit, she decided to show me her island. Shedropped off her Mom and picked up her kids and thendrove me around, we visited the solar salt works, morethen one lighthouse, the old slave huts, fort, thehighest mountain, and the windsurfing area. I stayedin the capital city that is called Kralendijk it wasfive minutes away from the airport and the heart wherethe tourist stay. Here I felt the white Dutch mastershad too much power and the kind black slaves were sogenerous. I stayed here the least time, and wanted tomove on.Last to Aruba, believe it or not but I could find ahotel with a reasonable price, $30 a night after sometalking and I did pay the first night $40 at anotherhotel. It had AC, cable TV and a private bathroom andall within fifteen minutes walk to the center of town.I guess the manager there so something special in meand and let me give her $150 in cash in advance for 5nights. Just kidding, but that is what happened. Butmy relationship with her grew and we would have a lotof talks about life and her plans. I either got real close to her or made her feel realguilty but she became my occasional ride from thehotel to some place, and also I had her volunteer togive me a tour of the Island. She took me to the oldDutch windmill, Hooiberg which is the tallest mountainwhich I hiked up for the view, Casibart rockformation, Bushiribana ruins, Natural bridge over thesea, the town of San Nicolas that had a huge refinery,and also a few beaches. Don&apos;t think that I did not seeanything on my own here, I visited the Californialighthouse which is on the most northern point andalso the Alto vista Chapel the oldest church on theIsland. I went to the Synagogue for Friday nightservices. I sat through two time share presentationsand got some gifts and went to one casino and gave itall back and more by playing Baccarat again. Butbecause I lost some money I could ask the CasinoManager for some tickets to the Cabaret dance show andon the last night there, I surprised my Hotel Managerwith tickets for her, her family and me.

Cristal clear water and sugary sands.No large hotel chains, except the real exclusive ones have/or are building: Mandarin Oriental/Aman/Ritz Carlton. No chain restuarants like the Caymans.
