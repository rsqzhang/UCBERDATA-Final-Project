36,23,""" A Cruise to Greenland,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in August 2004<BR> <BR>Greenland is the largest island in the world. Although it has an area of 2.2 million square km, only 410,000 square km is not ice-covered. In fact, the Greenland ice sheet is the second largest in the world. The average ice thickness is 1,500 meters, and the ice sheet constitutes 10% of the world's fresh water. If Greenland's ice cap were to melt, sea level would rise by seven meters!<BR><BR>Greenland's first Stone Age inhabitants migrated from North America nearly 5,000 years ago. The Thule, who were closely related to the Inuit, arrived later in about 900 A. D., and Inuit migration continued until the late nineteenth century. Norse settlements were begun in 985 A. D. and lasted until the middle of the fifteenth century. European whalers visited Greenland from the sixteenth century onward, and a Norwegian priest settled there in 1721. Because the priest had received official Danish support for his expedition, his arrival ushered in a colonial era that lasted some two and a half centuries. A 1953 constitution granted Greenland home rule under Danish sovereignty. Essentially Greenland then became a province of Denmark. <BR><BR>Approximately 56,000 people live in Greenland. Of this total, some 49,000 were born there. Over 75% of the population lives in towns, of which Nuuk on Greenland's west coast is the largest. The central portion of western Greenland is the most densely populated. There 60% of the people swell in the six largest towns. The remainder live a rural existence in about 120 trading posts and sheep stations.<BR><BR>Sheep farming is practiced in the South. Fishing, however, is the major industry; and the cold-water prawn is the most important fishing product. Greenland halibut is also significant. Prawns constitute 64% of Greenland's exports. Halibut, crab and cod make up most of the remainder.<BR><BR>In August 2003 I sailed on Holland America Lines' MS Rotterdam from Rotterdam the New York City via Greenland. The Rotterdam sailed through beautiful Prins Christian Sund (Prince Christian Sound) and then called at the town of Qaqortoq on Greenland's southwest coast.<BR><BR>In southern Greenland there is a network of channels and fjords stretching 450 km. Prins Christian Sund, one of these channels, is navigable only from the middle of summer until late autumn. This remote area offers spectacular scenery. Glaciers, waterfalls, 1400-meter-high granite peaks and icebergs can all be seen. Prins Christian Sund is 58 km long and only 480 meters wide at its narrowest point. By comparison, the length of the Rotterdam is 237 meters.<BR><BR>Qaqortog, the largest town is southern Greenland with a population of 3,600, is situated in the area where Norsemen settled in the tenth century. Is is unclear why Norse settlement in Greenland failed by the fifteenth century. However, Norse ruins can still be seen today 15 km from town. Qaqortoq was founded in 1775 by a Norwegian trader. The town was originally named Junianehab after Danish Queen Juliana Marie. Julianehab became the largest trading post in southern Greenland, and it maintains that distinction today. The oldest standing house was built in 1797.<BR><BR>As is the case with all towns in Greenland, Qaqortoq has no road connections with any other city. Instead, the inhabitants of Qaqortoq use ferries and helicopters for public transportation. Because the harbor in Qaqortoq is small, the Rotterdam sat at anchor and passengers were taken ashore by the ship's tenders.<BR><BR>Qaqortoq is an academic center, with both a vocational school and a commercial college which, interestingly, offers a course in tourism. In addition, a nearby agricultural research station trains sheep farmers and operates an experimental farm.<BR><BR>It was interesting to walk in the center of Qaqortoq where several wooden and stone houses date back to the nineteenth century. A decade ago 18 Scandinavian sculptors created works of art on solid rock faces and on boulders lying around town. Today 24 sculptures exist. Too, Qaqortoq boasts Greenland's only fountain. Built in 1928, this sits in a town square. Finally, there is a small museum. <BR><BR>HOW TO GET TO GREENLAND:</P><P>Greenland can be reached by air from a number of cities, including: Baltimore, MD, USA; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Reykjavik, Iceland. In the summer cruise ships regularly call at ports in southern Greenland also.<BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P>",229
0,23,"""A Cruise to Tristan da Cunha Island in the South Atlantic 15-28 January 2004 via the RMS St. Helena"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2004. <br><br>PART ONE:<br><br>The British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), 1,750 miles (2,816 km) southwest of Cape Town and 1,450 miles (2,333 km) southwest of St. Helena Island, is the most remote inhabited island in the world.  Roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo and situated just east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, TDC rises spectacularly some 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) from the seabed; and its peak, snow-covered during the Southern Hemisphere winter, lies 6,760 feet (2,060 meters) above sea level.<br><br>Discovered by the Portuguese admiral Tristao da Cunha in 1506, TDC has been inhabited almost continuously since 1810 due to the activities of sealers who operated in the South Atlantic during the nineteenth century.  A small British garrison was also placed on the island during the early years of Napoleons captivity on nearby St. Helena.<br><br>The correct pronunciation of the Portuguese admiral's name is ""tristan da koon'yah.""  However, the modern-day inhabitants pronounce the name of their island ""tristan da koo'nah."" <br><br>I have been fascinated by the geography and history of remote TDC since<br>I began collecting stamps as a young teenager in the early 1960s.  In 1999 I joined the St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Philatelic Society.  But it was my passion to complete the list of 317 world destinations compiled by the 1,500-member Travelers' Century Club of Los Angeles which recently drove me to take a 13-day cruise round trip from Cape Town to TDC on a luxury cargo vessel, the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS). <br><br>Launched in 1989 by HRH The Prince Andrew, the RMS was the first vessel to be purpose-built for the shipping service to U. K.s South Atlantic islands of St. Helena, Ascension and TDC.  In addition, it was the first passenger ship to be constructed in Britain since the QE2 had been built two decades earlier.<br><br>As we sailed out of Cape Town Harbor, the view from the deck of the RMS  was stunning.  Cape Town, with dramatic Table Mountain behind, is the most beautiful port in the world.  Half way to Cape Point, the RMS turned abruptly and headed toward TDC which lay about 1,748 miles (2,812 km) to the west.<br><br>TDC, a dependency of St. Helena, is administered by the governor of that island, to whom a permanent administrator on TDC reports.  The current governor, H. E. David Hollamby, was also on board the RMS for its final round trip sailing to TDC.  Although the RMS has a capacity of 128 passengers, only 57 were on board for this cruise, along with 56 crew members.  And the RMS was carrying only 38 metric tons of cargo to TDC even though the ship has a cargo capacity of 2,030 metric tons.  Sadly, Governor Hollamby said that it had become impossible to justify the expense of the annual RMS voyage to TDC when usage was so low.  <br><br>Due to rain and clouds on the morning of 21 January, TDC could not be seen until the RMS was only about two miles (3 km) away!  Africa Pilot, published by the U. K. Hydrographic Office, says that TDC, at 37 degrees, 7 minutes S., 12 degrees 18 minutes W., is a ""truncated cone about 6 miles in diameter with its sides rising at an angle of about 45 degrees to a central peak 2,060 meters in height.  The sides of the island consist of walls of inaccessible cliffs from 300 meters to 610 meters in height which rise, except on its northwest side, directly from the sea.  On this side there is, in front of the cliffs, a comparatively low grassy slope from 30 meters to 60 meters high which terminates in Herald Point, the northwest extremity of the island.  The sides of the mountain mass as far as the central dome are covered with brushwood intermixed with ferns and long grass.  But above 1500 meters, coinciding with the normal upper level of clouds, the mountains consist of loose stones and volcanic rubble with occasional rocks and boulders.""  <br><br>The RMS dropped anchor off Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, TDC's only settlement.  Formerly called Somerset, Edinburgh had been renamed after the 1867 visit of HRH The Prince Albert, second son of Queen Victoria.  Interestingly, the current Duke of Edinburgh, HRH The Prince Philip, also visited TDC.  The population of Edinburgh is 285.<br><br>Upon our arrival, some of the crew began fishing off the poop deck for yellowfish and five fingers using hooks and lines with bait; and it seemed as if they were pulling in one fish after the next.  As soon as one fish was snagged, hauled in and placed in a plastic sack, each fisherman re-baited and awaited the next bite, which didn't take long.  The waters off TDC are simply teeming with fish.<br><br>The first boat out to the RMS carried the administrator, the islands only policeman and three immigration officials who sat at a table in the main lounge where passengers who wished to go ashore paid a Sterling 15 (USD 28) landing fee.  Passports were stamped using a rubber stamp with a design showing a yellow-nosed albatross (known locally as a ""mollymauk""), the silhouette of the island and the British crown along with the words, ""Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""<br> <br>Governor Hollamby's official party was in the first boat to go ashore.  I was in the first of two other passenger boats after that.  The use of a rope ladder and safety harness off the RMS in a heavy swell made it very slow going.  Passengers had been warned how dangerous it can be to disembark and embark using the rope ladder as ones foot can be crushed  between the RMS and one of the small boats.  During the past 20 years no passenger injuries had ever resulted from the use of a rope ladder on the RMS at TDC.  But in 2003 one crew member did break his foot.<br><br>Edinburgh's shallow Calshot Harbor was named after the former Royal Air Force station near Southampton where the Tristanians had lived for about a year following their evacuation after a volcanic eruption on TDC in 1961.  Calshot Harbor's two jetties had been sturdily constructed of double-ended anchor-shaped concrete blocks.<br><br>Removing the life vest I had worn ashore in the boat, I walked up the paved road to the often-photographed sign which reads, ""Welcome to the Remotest Island - Tristan da Cunha - South Atlantic.""  Adjacent to that sign is a marker which points the direction and mileage to various points around the globe:  Nightingale Island is 22 miles (35 km) away, the Falkland Islands are 2,166 miles (3,485 km) away and London is 5,337 miles (8,587 km) away.<br><br>After visiting the post office, I walked to the three-room museum and handicraft center.  The museum featured a copy of the flag of Jonathan Lambert, an American who had declared himself emperor of the ""Islands of Refreshment"" (TDC) in 1811.  The ensign of the Duke of Edinburgh, which last flew at TDC during the January 1957 royal visit of HRH The Prince Philip, was also displayed.  In addition, a cannon ball and various old rusted implements were shown.  In another room unique TDC wingless moths were displayed as were various geological specimens, a TDC crayfish (fishing for crayfish, or rock lobster, is the mainstay of the economy) and even the head of a rare Tasman whale which had once beached in the TDC Archipelago.  In that same room was a photocopy obtained from the British Museum of TDC's original constitution which dated back to 1817.<br><br>Then I went by the Rectory to the Residency, where the administrator  resides.  There a vintage cannon rests on the well-manicured lawn near the flagpole from which the Union Jack flies.  <br><br>Behind the Residency is a 9-hole golf course.  Apparently a spare set of golf clubs at the Residency can be borrowed, and a certificate is issued to those who have played the course.  Blue TDC Golf Club ties were also sold as souvenirs on the island. <br><br>As I walked up the paved lane along the side of the Residency, I noticed a number of canvas sailboats which had been tied down there with ropes in order to prevent their being blown about by strong winds.  <br><br>My next stop was Prince Philip Hall, the community center.  The roof of this building was blown off during a hurricane which struck Edinburgh in May 2001.  Currently the school hall nearby is used for community gatherings.  <br><br>I walked through the paved lanes of the settlement past many small houses with lovely flowers in their gardens.  The most prominent of the flowers were the hydrangeas.  Strolling along, I was struck by the large number of automobiles parked in the driveways.  Most vehicles seemed to have 4-wheel drive capability, but I did notice one small sedan car too.  Painted bright red, it seemed a bit out of place.  There was also a farm tractor with a flatbed trailer in Edinburgh.<br><br>Then I crossed a small stream and struck out across a daisy-filled cow pasture toward the lava cone formed by the eruption which began in October 1961.  After climbing over a low lava rock wall and skirting a few inquisitive cows grazing in the fields, I hiked up along the grassy ravine adjacent to the volcanic cone, following some well-trodden cow paths.  About half way up I turned and took a photograph over the settlement.  <br><br>From my high vantage point I could also see Edinburgh's small water reservoir to my left at the base of the steep cliffs.  The water drunk on TDC is precipitation that has fallen high on the mountain in the form of rain or snow and has filtered down through the basalt, finally emanating from a spring near the settlement.  Those who have drunk TDC water say that it has a fine taste.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>PART TWO:<br><br>In January 2004 I enjoyed a unique cruise on the final voyage of the Royal Mail Ship St. Helena (RMS) round trip from Cape Town to the remote British island of Tristan da Cunha (""TDC""), roughly midway between Cape Town and Montevideo.  <br><br>During my eight hours in TDC's only settlement, Edinburgh, which has a population of 285, I wandered into Jane's Café, the islands only restaurant, where I found a number of other RMS passengers enjoying drinks, sandwiches and dessert.  As crayfish (rock lobster) is the mainstay of TDCs economy, it was not surprising that crayfish sandwiches were sold at the café.  Chocolate sponge cake, beer and soft drinks were also available.  The proprietress took little notice of me as she continued her knitting.  A notice to the islands 285 residents posted on the cafe's bulletin board by the dental nurse warned that appointments for the upcoming dental visit had to be made at the hospital before 28 January 2004.  Outside Jane's Cafe were the only public W. C.s in Edinburgh.   <br><br>As I found the door unlocked, I photographed the interior of the empty Roman Catholic Church nearby.  Although I had passed the Rectory earlier, I never did find Edinburgh's Anglican Church which is said to contain an old photograph of Queen Victoria.<br><br>Continuing my walk, I passed Camogli Hospital.  The operating room and the X-ray machine in this facility suffered severe damage in a 2001 hurricane.  Nowadays from the outside one would never guess that the hurricane had caused one-quarter of the building to collapse. <br><br>At the far end of Edinburgh is a typical British bus stop sign.  Walking down the cement road beyond the sign, I found myself at the bottom of a steep, dry ravine.  In rainy times I imagined that this gulch must turn into a raging torrent of water, pushing boulders in its path.  The road was not paved across the floor of the gulch, but the cement did continue again up the far bank.  I continued to the top of the far embankment and saw a wide expanse of grassland ahead.  The paved road extended all the way beyond the grassy cinder cone in the distance to the Potato Patches which lie some 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away.  There islanders cultivate potatoes and other crops.  And I have read that on Friday afternoons a vehicle does in fact take residents from the Edinburgh bus stop to their ""weekend homes"" in the potato patches!   <br><br>Then I walked to the school on the opposite side of Edinburgh.  Along the way I took photographs of some of the settlement's dogs.  Though I passed many dogs today, not a single animal barked at me and only one even came up to sniff me.  In the school hall I purchased a first day cover from one of the women selling handicrafts and souvenirs.  I also made a donation to the headmistress for the school. <br><br>Beyond the school toward the lava flow lie three graveyards surrounded by low lava rock walls.  One graveyard is Anglican, another is Roman Catholic and a third is apparently for Freemasons.  All graves appeared to be well-tended and most were covered with cut flowers.  Outside the lava walls cows grazed lazily in the fields.<br><br>As I had heard that rockhopper penguins could sometimes be seen at Pigbite, the beach beyond the 1961 lava flow, I next wandered in that direction.  The half hour walk over the lava flow to a beach with large boulders revealed where TDC's outdated heavy equipment and various pieces of scrap metal had been junked.  This is also where TDC's garbage is burned.    <br><br>While I never did find any penguins, my walk over to the beach was an interesting one.  On the side of the road in the direction of Edinburgh I noticed huge fissures in the lava.  These fissures could only have been created by earthquakes.  Then when I reached the far side of the lava flow I saw a small waterfall created by a spring emanating from a point low on the cliff.  The wind was gusting strongly as I stepped over a small brook and began to walk across a grassy field.  There I was able to photograph a few skuas resting in a depression.  The large birds let me approach more closely than I had expected, but eventually they rose and floated away in the wind. <br><br>From the beach I returned to Edinburgh.  Realizing that I was hungry, I dropped into the local supermarket to purchase a small imported apple for eight pence.  The supermarket stocks many types of canned goods and dry goods plus frozen items and even handicrafts, including knitted sweaters.  While the fruit and vegetable department was nothing like back home, that was perfectly understandable, considering its location.  In general, though, I was surprised at just how much variety was available at the supermarket.  Adjacent to it were other stores selling plumbing and electrical goods.<br><br>In the early evening a final boat removed all passengers who wished to return to the RMS.  I often prefer to be one of the last persons to enter a small boat in order to avoid having to rock and roll while waiting for all the other passengers to board.  Consequently, because of my physical position in the boat, sometimes I am one of the first people to disembark.  <br><br>That was the case this time.  When I climbed the rope ladder up into the RMS, the small boat was sitting relatively still in the water.  But I had to hang around to wait for my backpack to be lifted up along with all the other loose passenger gear.  So I was in a good position to hear the horror stories told by those pale passengers who did not disembark until the very end.  Apparently shortly after I climbed the rope ladder the wind had shifted, causing the small boat to begin to flip around fairly violently.<br><br>What kind of person would ever consider taking a 13-day round trip cruise from Cape Town to TDC, you might wonder?  <br><br>The RMS passenger list included Jan and Kirsten, a Norwegian couple who seemed to specialize in traveling to obscure places.  Jan showed me his passport which even contained a visa for the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which surrounded by Azerbaijan.  This enclave is not on the Travelers' Century Club list and, interestingly, Jan and Kirsten had never even heard of the Travelers' Century Club.<br><br>TDC was the 286th Travelers' Century Club destination for George, a retired American doctor.  After Cape Town he planned to spend five days on Rodrigues Island, a dependency of Mauritius, before flying home to San Diego via the Kalahari and the Algarve.  George was finishing a five-month trip in fulfillment of his quest.  And, though we are fellow Travelers' Century Club members, George's quest was much more involved than my own.  In addition to traveling to all 317 world destinations on the Travelers' Century Club list, he was also trying to visit all of the world's major natural features such as deserts, etc.   <br><br>Richard, the only other American on board, planned to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway next year from Moscow to Vladivostok.  Like a surprising number of others on board, he was a repeat passenger on the RMS, having previously sailed to St. Helena and Ascension.<br><br>Walter, one of a number of Germans on the RMS, was the Hamburg-based producer of the German television crew.  He once spent a week filming on Jan Mayen Land, a Norwegian island situated between Spitzbergen and Iceland, and had also traveled to remote parts of Iran and Oman.  Incidentally, Walter, who once worked in Cairo as a journalist and is married to a Palestinian, was the only other Arabic speaker on board aside from myself.  <br><br>Stan, a retired professor of Canadian studies from Fredericton, NB, had been involved with philately since the age of six.  His interest in postal history led him to visit some stamp shops in Cape Town prior to the cruise in order to check out their covers.<br><br>Others, like South Africans James and Tara, booked at the last minute and benefited from a 50% fare discount.<br><br>John, a discriminating traveler from London, planned to take an 80-day round-the-world cruise on the Oriana next year.<br><br>There were five Swiss on the RMS.  Jean, Yves and Leopoldine, three friends from Geneva, were avid sailors who, in their younger days, used to sail their yacht around Europe at every opportunity.  Stefan, from Zurich, was an experienced and sophisticated traveler who had rented a house and car for a week-long holiday in a seaside suburb of Cape Town nearly every Northern Hemisphere winter for the last 15 years.  He confided that South Africa represented excellent value for the Swiss.  <br><br>Stefan's lively and inquisitive friend Yalgin, of Turkish extraction but with a Swiss passport, was interested in odd destinations.  Yalgin, who collected airline sickness bags, entertained us at dinner one night with stories about Busingen and Campione dal Italia, German and Italian enclaves in Switzerland, respectively, and about Samnaun, a Swiss town which must be accessed from Austria as no direct road connection exists with Switzerland.    <br><br>Dacre, a former pilot for British Airways and later, after retirement, with Singapore Airlines, and his wife Ann were booked on the RMS all the way north to Ascension.  Both spent their childhood years in Chile, where they met.  Dacre was fascinated by the controls on the bridge, and our captain took special pleasure in explaining the instruments to him.  Dacre collected old airline timetables, some of which are apparently very valuable.<br><br>The remaining passengers were mostly British but with a number of Germans and South Africans also in evidence.  Surprisingly, several elderly British were on the passenger list.  Some were traveling alone.  Eve mentioned that she had taken the RMS to St. Helena on another occasion and came along on this cruise to TDC as the captain had told her how interesting TDC was.<br><br>In spite of their varied travel experiences, most passengers felt that this cruise to Tristan da Cunha on the RMS St. Helena was a unique experience which they will remember for the rest of their lives. <br><br><BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",235

37,23,"""Greece's Corinth Canal,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in November 2007 </SPAN></P><P >On the afternoon of 24 May 2007 I was a passenger on the 208-passenger, 10,000-ton <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> when that vessel made a transit of the 3.9-mile (6.3-km)-long Corinth Canal from west to east. <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> is 439 feet (134 meters) long and 63 feet (19.2 meters) wide. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal connects the Gulf of Corinth with the Aegean Sea's Saronic Gulf. Cutting through the sandy alluvial soil of the Isthmus of Corinth, the canal separates the Peloponnesian peninsula from the Greek mainland. In effect, the canal creates an island out of the Peloponnesus. <BR><BR>The Corinth Canal, only 68.9 feet (21 meters) wide and 26 feet (8 meters) deep, was constructed between 1881 and 1893. First the two ends were dug by a French firm. Then, after that company went bankrupt, a Greek contractor completed the work. The opening of the Corinth Canal a mere two dozen years after the opening of the Suez Canal helped to propel the Greek port of Piraeus into a major Mediterranean port. However, the expected windfall from canal tolls never materialized. In this age of supertankers, the Corinth Canal bears an anachronistic charm. <BR><BR>Because of the dangers faced by ancient mariners in their small boats, the idea of a canal across the narrow Ismthus of Corinth arose thousands of years ago. The first to attempt the construction of a canal was Periander, the seventh-century ruler of Corinth. Although Periander failed to dig much, he did improve upon the previous method of hauling small craft across the isthmus. That method involved pulling boats over large wooden rollers. Under Periander a stone trackway was built on which wheeled, flat vehicles could be used to pull boats. In fact, that system of portage remained in use until the twelfth century, and traces of the trackway can still be seen today near the canal's western end.<BR><BR>Roman Emperor Julius Caeser, who ruled from 48 to 44 B. C., also planned to build a canal across the Isthmus of Corinth. However, Caesar, of course, was assassinated. Later, in 54-68 A. D., the infamous Roman Emperor Nero actually participated in a ground-breaking ceremony for a canal using a golden pick, and six thousand Judean slaves began the excavation. But Nero, too, died shortly thereafter and the project was then abandoned until the late nineteenth century.<BR><BR>Small ships coming from the Western Mediterranean or from the Adriatic which are bound for the Eastern Mediterranean or the Black Sea find the Corinth Canal useful. Although ships narrow enough to utilize the canal can shave 248 miles (400 kilometers) off their journey, most of the 12,000 annual canal transits are now made for touristic purposes. Interestingly, the ships transiting the canal hail from more than 50 different countries.<BR> <BR>Two sightseeing options are available to those not able to sail on a cruise ship through the Corinth Canal. The canal can be viewed safely from the sidewalk of a highway bridge over the canal within a short distance of the town of Corinth. Also, according to <A style=""COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single"" href=""http://www.periandros.gr/"">www.periandros.gr</A>, the web site of the company which has a 30-year management contract for the canal, a 75-minute canal sightseeing cruise operates daily at 10 AM. This web site also features a toll calculator for ships. The calculation of tolls is based on a vessel's flag, the type of vessel, its port of origin, and its previous and next port in addition to the net tonnage. <BR><BR>On line at <A style=""COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single"" href=""http://www.eptours.com/T0711-corinth.htm"">www.eptours.com/T0711-corinth.htm</A> readers will find links to three video clips showing my canal transit. <I>Seabourn Spirit</I> is seen being pulled by a tugboat, surrounded by the canal's very steep walls, which are 170 feet (52 meters) high. One video clip shows a movable bridge and the control tower at the eastern end of the canal. In addition, in that clip the current appears to flow from east to west through the canal. The difference between high and low water levels in the canal is approximately two feet (60 cm). </SPAN></P><P >Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>21 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/"">www.tedcookson.com </A></SPAN></P>",270
34,23,"""Italy's Amalfi Coast,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2007 <BR><BR> </P><O:P><P >The Amalfi Coast on the southern part of the Sorrento Peninsula is one of the prettiest areas in Italy. The Amalfi Drive, hugging the coast of the Campania region along the Gulf of Salerno, has been called Italy's most romantic road. This narrow, winding cliff-hanging byway, in places carved right out of the side of the mountain, is a challenge to navigate. However, those traversing the Amalfi Drive are rewarded with spectacular views of small coves and of boats bobbing in the azure sea far below. Amalfi and Positano are the two most popular spots along the Amalfi Coast. </P><P >Amalfi, 61 km (38 miles) east of Sorrento and with a population of only 5,500, is the largest town on this coast. Dramatically situated at the mouth of a ravine under towering 1,315-meter (4,312-foot) Mt. Cerreto, the burg is sandwiched between tall cliffs and a rocky coastline broken occasionally by coves with sandy beaches. </P><P >Amalfi's rich history is not evident from what tourists see today. Incredibly, this small town was once the capital of the seafaring Republic of Amalfi, one of the great maritime powers. From the ninth to the eleventh century Amalfi rivaled Venice and Genoa for influence in the Mediterranean. </P><P >The first mention of Amalfi dates from the sixth century, and a circular maritime trade with the East developed soon thereafter. Grain, slaves, salt and timber were traded to Egypt and Syria for gold dinars. These coins were then paid to the Byzantines for silk which was in turn sold back in Europe. Independent from the seventh century until 1075, Amalfi reached the height of its power in about 1000 when it boasted a population of 70,000. Not only was the ship compass introduced to Europe in 1302 by Flavio Gioia, an Amalfi native, but Amalfi's maritime code was used in the Mediterranean until 1570. </P><P >Positano, a picturesque seaport of 3,900 lying 17 km (11 miles) west of Amalfi, was part of the maritime Republic of Amalfi in the tenth century. However, Positano's apogee came much later. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ships from Positano carried silk, spices and wood to the Middle East. The subsequent decline of Positano's prosperity coincided with the rise of steamships in the mid-nineteenth century. As much as three-quarters of the town's population of 8,000 immigrated to the United States, with the majority going to New York. Interestingly, one of the tough tasks that faced later mayors of Positano was finding enough burial plots for those very emigrees, many of whom wanted to be buried back in their birthplace. </P><P >Positano, little more than a sleepy fishing village in the early twentieth century, was discovered after World War II when American troops, stationed in nearby Salerno, began taking holidays there. In the 1950s writers such as John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams and painters such as Paul Klee were drawn to Positano. In the 1960s Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones composed the lyrics to their song Midnight Rambler while on holiday in Positano. The rest, as they say, is history. Today tourism is the major industry, and the town is simply besieged by Europeans and North Americans during the summer. Positano is now among Europe's most chic destinations. </P><P >Sorrento, on the Gulf of Naples, is the gateway to the Amalfi Coast. With a population of 17,000, Sorrento lies at the western end of the Amalfi Drive. It can be reached easily by train, bus, ferry or hydrofoil from Naples, only 50 km (30 miles) away, or by ferry or hydrofoil from the Isle of Capri. Local coastal ferries operate along the Amalfi Coast between Sorrento in the west and Salerno in the east. In summer there are also ferry and hydrofoil services between Amalfi, Positano and Capri and between Amalfi, Positano and Naples. </P></O:P></SPAN><O:P><P ><BR>Ted Cookson </P><P >Manager - Maadi </P><P >Egypt Panorama Tours </P><P >Cairo, Egypt<BR>1 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P><P > </P></O:P>",279
41,23,"""The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in July 2005<BR> <BR>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, opened in </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> , </SPAN> Spain</SPAN> in 1997. This institution, now an icon for </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN>'s progress, helped to spur a cultural renaissance and surge in tourism to the city. <BR><BR>Although the museum's impressive collection includes a broad spectrum of modern and contemporary art, it is the innovative building itself which is the city's stunning architectural jewel. Centered around an atrium that is 164 feet (50 meters) high are 19 galleries plus an auditorium, a restaurant and offices. The museum's floor area is 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters), nearly half of which is exhibition space. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao also includes the world's largest exhibition hall, some 422 feet (130 meters) long. <BR><BR>Architect Frank Gehry was faced with some difficult design problems. On one side of the museum site in central </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> is the </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName>Nervion</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> </SPAN><st1:PlaceType>River</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> ; on this side the site is 52 feet (16 meters) below the level of the rest of the city. On another end is a bridge which serves as one of the city's major access routes. Yet Gehry managed to overcome these issues successfully, integrating his avant garde building into the city's urban fabric. <BR><BR>The museum building is an unorthodox combination of connected shapes. The beautiful titanium exterior panels, 0.2 inch (0.5 mm) thick, give the surface a certain tactile feel. It has even been said that this extraordinary building constitutes a novel form of architecture! <BR><BR></SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> is </SPAN> Spain</SPAN>'s fourth largest city; its metropolitan area contains roughly half of northern </SPAN> Spain</SPAN>'s Basque population. </SPAN> Bilbao</SPAN> has served as the industrial and financial center of the Basque homeland since the mid-nineteenth century.

30,23,"""Viewing HMS Bounty</EM> Artifacts on a Day Trip from London to Greenwich, England,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2005<BR> </SPAN> <BR>Maritime buffs can enjoy an interesting day trip from London to the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site, which offers a number of attractions. Greenwich, literally the ""green village,"" contains crooked lanes, bric-a-brac shops and bustling antique and flea markets. HMAS (Her Majesty's Armed Ship) <I>Bounty</I> and Pitcairn Island enthusiasts will be drawn in particular to the National Maritime Museum (NMM) and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG).<BR><BR>The NMM (http:\\www.nmm.ac.uk) is a state-of-the-art facility with fascinating displays on Britain's maritime past, present and future. Founded in 1934, this is the world's largest nautical museum, with a collection of over two million items. Its 20 galleries display some of the finest objects, covering many aspects of ships, seafaring and marine affairs. The museum is housed in historic buildings which were formerly a school for the sons of seamen.<BR><BR>A number of artifacts from the <I>Bounty</I> are showcased in the Trade and Empire gallery, including a coconut shell, a horn cup and a small weight used to measure out portions of food. Presumably these instruments were used by William Bligh and his loyalists on their lengthy longboat voyage. A worm-eaten piece of wood from the <I>Bounty</I>'s rudder is displayed as are a corkscrew and a pipe said to have belonged to Bligh. A braided grey lock of mutineer John Adams' hair several inches long is also exhibited. Adjacent to that is John Adams' original grave marker from Pitcairn Island. John Adams was the last of the mutineers to die on Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific.<BR><BR>Although one of the museum's most fascinating <I>Bounty</I>-related items is not on display, it can be viewed easily upon application to the NMM's Caird Library. This library contains a copy of ""The Log of HMS Bounty 1787-1789"" by William Bligh. The volume in the museum is number 236 of a limited edition of 500 copies published in 1975 by Genesis Publications of Surrey, England. The book is a photographic reproduction of the original handwritten document which is held at the Public Records Office in Kew, England. Upon opening the <I>Bounty</I> log to page 248, visitors can read Bligh's own longhand account of the events of the mutiny on 28 April 1989. <BR><BR>Just across the park and up a small hill is the ROG (http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/navId/005000002002),<BR>which was founded in 1675 by King Charles II and designed by Sir Christopher Wren. The original purpose of the ROG was to provide accurate charts of the stars in order to improve navigation. Today this institution is the home of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees). <BR><BR>GMT, of course, is the basis of standard time throughout the world. The Shepherd gate clock at the ROG, installed in 1852 and still functioning, was the first public clock to display GMT. The ROG's red rooftop ball has dropped daily at precisely 1 p.m. since 1833. This used to assist mariners on the Thames to set their chronometers. <BR><BR>The prime meridian is the zero point which has been used in the calculation of terrestrial longitudes since 1884. Visitors may have their photographs taken at the meridian line while straddling two hemispheres. <BR><BR>On exhibit at the ROG are the four well-known marine timekeepers completed by John Harrison between 1735 and 1759. In addition, Larcum Kendall's second timekeeper is on display. This chronometer, known as K2, was built in 1771. A simplified and cheaper version of Harrison's H4 timekeeper, which itself dates to 1759, K2 was used by Captain Phipps on his Arctic voyage of discovery in 1773 and was later issued to William Bligh for use on the <I>Bounty</I>. <BR><BR>The Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site also includes some other places of general interest. The seventeenth-century Palladian Queen's House was England's first purely classical building. Designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 as a retreat for Anne of Denmark, queen to James I, the building was refurbished in 2001 and now provides well-lit galleries. The Queen's House contains the Tulip Stairs which date to 1635. This was Britain's first centrally unsupported spiral stairway.<BR><BR>The outstanding painted hall and chapel of the nearby Old Royal Naval College, originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1695 to house naval pensioners, are also open to the public. The buildings, which became the Royal Naval College in 1873, are said to be a Baroque masterpiece. <BR><BR>The hauntingly beautiful and much-visited <I>Cutty Sark</I>, launched in 1869 and the last of the China tea clipper ships, has been in dry dock at Greenwich Pier since 1954. Nearby, also in dry dock is <I>Gipsy Moth</I> IV, in which Sir Francis Chichester circumnavigated the world in 119 days in 1967. <BR><BR>Those who collect maritime history books will appreciate the existence of a nautical bookstore in Greenwich. Those not tempted by nautical books may enjoy browsing instead in one of Greenwich's four interesting bargain bookstores where every title is marked down to only Sterling 2.00. <BR><BR>Greenwich can be reached easily by riverboat in about an hour from Embankment Pier, Tower Millennium Pier, Waterloo Millennium Pier or Westminster Millennium Pier, all in central London. This has been called the best boat ride in London. Even Henry VIII arrived in Greenwich by boat on one of his hunting expeditions. Today visitors ride by the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the recently-developed Docklands area. Three miles downstream the Thames erupts into one of the most sublime sights of English architecture. Minutes later the masts and rigging of the <I>Cutty Sark</I> finally come into view. <BR><BR>And yet a day trip from London to Greenwich can be quite inexpensive. A round trip boat ticket is about Sterling 6.00 ($10.25). Or, for only Sterling 4.10 ($7.00), visitors to London may purchase a Day Travelcard valid for unlimited travel on the underground, buses and the modern Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in zones one and two. This pass may be purchased at certain main underground stations only after 9:30 a.m., and it is valid until 4:30 a.m. the following day. <BR><BR>More expensive versions of the Day Travelcard exist for those requiring travel in additional zones and/or travel on multiple days. The Travelcard is also sold at Heathrow Airport's tube stations after 9:30 a.m. Incidentally, holders of a Travelcard are entitled to one-third off the price of most riverboat services.<BR><BR>Visitors will find it convenient to change from the Jubilee Line of the underground to the DLR at Canary Wharf where only a short walk is required. It is best to alight from the DLR at the ""<I>Cutty Sark</I> for Maritime Greenwich"" station. Signs are posted to the various attractions in Greenwich. Admission is free to both the NMM and the ROG. Restaurants and sandwich shops in the compact area of maritime Greenwich enable visitors to spend an entire day there, including a lovely indoor lunch or a picnic outdoors in the park or near the pier. <BR><BR><BR><B>AUTHOR'S NOTE:<BR></B><BR>For nearly 40 years I have been fascinated by the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and by Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific where the mutineers fled. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read the Nordhoff and Hall <I>Bounty</I> Trilogy and then began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. Recently I realized that it would be very easy for me to view some of the original artifacts relating to the <I>Bounty</I> saga. After visiting Greenwich, England in July 2003 I wrote the short article above. <BR><BR>I realize that most other people will not have the same level of interest as I have in the <I>Bounty</I> and in Pitcairn Island. Nevertheless I hope that this article may stimulate others to realize that, similarly, it might not be so difficult for them to visit locations or museums which may hold original artifacts relating to a topic which may be of interest to them. <P><BR>Ted Cookson<BR> Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR> 5 January 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com</FONT> </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com</FONT> </A></P>",260

Of the total population of some 250,000, only about 5,000 live on Porto Santo. <BR><BR>Sugar cane was one of the earliest crops grown in the archipelago. By 1514 some 5,000 permanent inhabitants were farming on </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN >. Funchal, with its pretty tile roofs, has always been the main port and capital. With a population of 150,000 inhabitants, Funchal, perhaps named for fennel (""funcho"" in Portuguese) which grew wild there, is situated in a beautiful natural amphitheatre. Sacked by the French in 1566, Funchal was not returned to </SPAN> <SPAN >Portugal</SPAN> <SPAN > until 1662. In 1801 and in 1807 an English fleet temporarily took over Funchal. <BR><BR>Tourism to </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > began in the 1890s and it was at this time that the British began arriving in numbers to reside.

Visitors come mostly from the European Union -- from </SPAN> <SPAN >Germany</SPAN> <SPAN >, the U. K. and </SPAN> <SPAN >Portugal</SPAN> <SPAN > in particular. March and April are the peak tourist months in spite of the fact that the best time to visit is during the dry season from May through September. <BR><BR>The highlight of many a tourist's visit to </SPAN> <SPAN >Madeira</SPAN> <SPAN > is riding a cable car from Funchal up to Monte and then being pushed 2 km (1.2 miles) back down toward Funchal in a wicker toboggan sledge mounted on two wooden runners. It is thought that Funchal's two-seat wicker toboggan sledges were developed around 1850 for the very practical reason of speeding transport into town. Today's tourists can still thrill to this adrenaline-raising but very safe experience where speeds of up to 48 km (30-miles) per hour can be achieved. The downhill journey from Nossa Senhora do </SPAN> <st1:PlaceName><SPAN >Monte</SPAN></st1:PlaceName><SPAN > </SPAN><st1:PlaceType><SPAN >Church</SPAN></st1:PlaceType> <SPAN > requires about 10 minutes.

50,23,"<body><p class=""MsoNormal"">""<b>Reunion Island, Secret of the Indian Ocean</b>,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in June 2009 <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Reunion, an overseas department of France, is situated some 800 km (500 miles) east of Madagascar and 200 km (130 miles) southwest of Mauritius.  With a length of 63 km (39 miles), a width of 45 km (28 miles) wide, and an area of 2,512 square km (970 square miles), Reunion was visited by the Portuguese in 1635 and then first occupied by the French from 1642 to 1649.  Although under British control from 1810 to 1815, immigration from France over the succeeding two centuries plus immigration of Africans, Indians, Chinese and Malays has given rise to a mix of ethnicities on the island.      <br><br>My last visit to Reunion was by cruise ship in April 2008.  I had reserved a Hertz rental van which the firm had agreed via email to deliver at the port.  Although Hertz kept reassuring me by phone that the van was on the way and would arrive shortly, after an hour and 45 minutes of waiting I finally gave up and hired a taxi van for 200 euros to take our party of six on a six-hour circular drive around the beautiful verdant island.  <br><br>From the port at La Possession on Reunion&apos;s west coast we drove past the many beach resorts which stretch south from St. Paul 45 km (28 miles) to St. Louis.  The best sandy beaches are on the west coast of the island.  Although we didn&apos;t have time that day to make the side trip from St. Louis into the center of the island to view Cirque de Cilaos, luckily I had done that on a previous visit.  Reunion boasts three cirques, which are spectacular calderas in the interior of the island formed long ago by collapsing underground lava chambers.  Eventually deep canyons were eroded from these amphitheaters out to the sea.  The roads into the cirques wind through these canyons up to grand vistas of volcanic peaks and forested ravines.  The 37-km (22-mile) road from the coast at St. Louis up to Cilaos boasts over 400 bends.  Cilaos, situated at a height of 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) and with a population of 6,000, was developed as a spa in the late nineteenth century.  On 15-16 March 1952 1,870 mm (73.6 inches) of rainfall fell at Cilaos.  This is the world record for the most rainfall ever recorded in a 24-hour period!  Tourists with enough time should attempt to view or visit all three of Reunion&apos;s cirques. <br><br>From St. Pierre south of St. Louis we headed inland, driving up to Reunion&apos;s High Plains which lie at about 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) and which separate the island&apos;s cirques from its volcano.  As we climbed, the temperature became much more comfortable.  The highlight of our day trip to Reunion was the lunar-like crater of Piton de la Fournaise, one of the world&apos;s most active and yet most accessible volcanos.  This shield volcano has erupted more than 100 times since 1640.  The lava flow from Piton de la Fournaise is roughly three million cubic meters (about 4 million cubic yards) per day!   Piton de la Fournaise is similar to the volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii in that they are all located above hot spots in the earth&apos;s crust.<br><br>Following our visit to the volcano, we stopped at the Nez de Boeuf viewpoint over the spectacular canyon of the Riviere des Remparts.  A popular ten-hour walk leads from this point down the steep cliff and onward by trail through a national forest to the town of St. Joseph on the south coast.  Then, after crossing through Reunion&apos;s interior, we descended to St. Benoit on the island&apos;s east coast and then continued north to the capital of St. Denis.  Founded in 1668, St. Denis was named for a ship which had sunk there.  With a population of 140,000, St. Denis, constructed on a grid pattern along the north coast, has a few buildings  interesting for their architecture as well as a pretty seaside park.<br><br>Although the population of Reunion is over 800,000, about half of the inhabitants actually live in France.  Nevertheless, interestingly, there are some 340,000 automobiles on Reunion!  Needless to say, the road system is excellent, and there is a motorway which wraps around a fair amount of the island&apos;s coastline.<br><br>Reunion is not usually thought of as a dive destination.  However, the island&apos;s west coast boasts some colorful and even stunning diving sites offering a wide array of tropical fish.  In October and November pelagic species such as barracuda and tuna are also in evidence.  The Indian Ocean waters surrounding Reunion are warmest (28 C./82 F.) between October and April.  At the other extreme, water temperatures drop to 21 C./70 F. in August.  Divers will want to avoid the height of the cyclone season, which is in February and March.  (Cyclones may arise anytime from December through March.)  Reunion&apos;s hot and rainy summer stretches from December until April while the cool and dry winter lasts from the end of April until October.  Reunion attracts the most tourists from late June until early September but there are also tourists aplenty from October until early January. <span style=""color: black""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 12.0pt""> </p>  <span

22,23,"<body><p>""<b>Malta, a Jewel in the Mediterranean</b>,"" written for the   expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2009 </p><p>Strategic Malta is situated in the Mediterranean Sea 93 km (58 miles) south of Sicily and 300 km (186 miles) north of Libya.  A member of the European Union since 1994, this tiny republic consists of three limestone islands:  246-square-km (94-square-mile) Malta, 61-square-km (24-square-mile) Gozo, and 3-square-km (1-square-mile) Comino.  The sprawling capital of Valletta and most of the national population of 403,000 are located on the island of Malta, which measures 27 km (17 miles) by 14.5 km (9 miles).  On the other hand, Gozo's population is only 31,000; and a mere eight people reside on Comino.  <br><br>Because barren Malta boasts no mountains, lakes or rivers, half of its fresh water requirements must be supplied through reverse osmosis.  Malta's two official languages are the Semitic Malti and English.  The latter is a reflection of the British presence in Malta from 1798 to 1979.  <br><br>Malta was first populated about 5000 B. C.  Between 3600 B. C. and 2,500 B. C. a number of stone temples were constructed, about two dozen of which still survive.  Malta was a Phoenician colony between 800 B. C. and 218 B. C.  Then, after the fall of Carthage, these islands were controlled by Rome.  The Arabs ruled from 870 A. D. until their expulsion in 1090 by King Roger of Sicily.  The Knights of St. John arrived in 1530 and remained for 268 years.  Napoleon held Malta for a two-year period from 1798.  This was followed by British rule until late in the twentieth century.  <br><br>The most famous event in Malta's history is the Great Siege of 1565 when an Ottoman fleet appeared carrying 30,000 men.  After a bloody three-month siege, relief finally arrived from Sicily; so the Ottomans withdrew.  Malta also suffered five months of severe bombing in 1942.<br><br>At the crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea, Malta's rich and fascinating history is a big draw for tourists.  The sunny climate is another factor which has contributed to the creation of a substantial tourism industry.  Over a million tourists visit Malta annually, and tourism represents up to 40% of Malta's gross national product.  Probably best known for its spectacular Grand Harbor, Malta's other top tourist sites include:  the baroque St. John's Co-cathedral constructed in 1573; the Grand Master's Palace built in 1571; star-shaped Fort St. Elmo at the mouth of the harbor; and the waterfront district of Vittoriosa.  Casa Rocca Piccola in downtown Valletta is also well worth a visit.  Constructed in the 1580s for the Knights of St. John, its current owner is a member of the de Piro Family.  The house may be viewed only by guided tour.<br><br>In the interior of Malta is the medieval walled village of Mdina, which today has a population of only 400.  Mdina's primary attraction is the baroque St. Paul's Cathedral built between 1697 and 1702.<br><br>Since flying time from Cairo is only two hours, Malta is ideal for a 3-day or 4-day getaway.  It is best to visit during the dry season months of April, May, June, September and October.  July and August are also good, although it is hotter then.  From November through February is the rainy season, with most precipitation falling in December and January.  Round trip airfare from Cairo to Malta on Egypt Air is EGP 2,500.  Egypt Air flies both ways on Thursday and Sunday.  Travel on any other day of the week requires a change of aircraft in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.  Travelers with a full week to spare should consider combining Malta with nearby Sicily.  Round trip ferries between Malta and Sicily begin from about Euro 100.<font size=""3""> </font><span style=""color: black""> </span></p><font size=""4""><a target=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtYjRq_fQjc"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=bpFX2yl6vkk"">Sailaway from Malta's Grand Harbor, 112-second video clip</a></font><br> <p>  <span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman""><b>Ted Cookson<br>  Manager - Maadi<br>  Egypt Panorama Tours<br>  Cairo, Egypt<br>  21 May 2009<br>  <a href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com</a><br>  <a href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com</a> </b></p></body>",294

In fact, most visitors proceed directly to their resort accommodations east or west of Faro by rental car, completely bypassing the city of Faro, which is the most populated town in the Algarve and its capital.<BR><BR>Many holiday villages are clustered around quaint Albufeira, which is situated near excellent beaches northwest of Faro. Albufeira is one of the Algarve's largest and most popular resort destinations. <BR><BR>An excellent day trip through the western part of the Algarve can be made by car using Albufeira as a base. The circuit includes the Moorish capital of Silves, the historic Sagres where Prince Henry the Navigator once dwelled, nearby Cape Vincent, and the small port of Lagos founded by the Phoenicians.<BR><BR>Silves, situated in the hills 18 km (11 miles) northeast of the port of Portimao, was the grand home of the Moorish kings who ruled the province of Al-Gharb which, incidentally, means ""the West"" in Arabic. Silves' picturesque medieval Moorish castle is the largest in the Algarve. Today a gigantic Crusader statue standing just outside the castle serves to remind that this fortress was sacked by Crusaders in 1189. Wonderful views of the surrounding countryside can be had from the walls of the castle, which still dominates Silves today. The town also boasts a Gothic cathedral built on the site of an old mosque. The streets of Silves are still laid out just as they were in the medieval medina. <BR><BR>It was at Sagres in the fifteenth century that Prince Henry the Navigator established his navigation school at which Magellan, Cabral and da Gama all studied. Today Prince Henry's fortaleza is the principal tourist site at Sagres. A fifteenth-century stone wind compass 43 meters (140 feet) in diameter dominates the entrance to the fortress, and there are spectacular sea views over the tall cliffs from the long walkway along the ancient walls. Interestingly, within the fortress, the altar of the sixteenth-century Church of Our Lady of Grace depicts Saint Vincent holding a ship.<BR><BR>Cape Vincent, Portugal's westernmost promontory, has been inhabited since the Neolithic era. In Classical times the cape was thought to be sacred. After the remains of Saint Vincent were brought there following the Arab invasion, Cape Vincent drew pilgrims for centuries. Today this spectacular but windy western promontory sports only a lighthouse, a tiny tourist market, and few fishermen trying their luck. <BR><BR>En route back to Albufeira is the fishing town of Lagos whose natural harbor attracted the Phoenicians. Later the Moors settled in Lagos until the town was retaken by Christian forces in 1241. Prince Henry used Lagos as a base for his African trade. In fact, Europe's first slave market was in Lagos. Today the town is known mainly for its nearby cliffs, coves and beautiful beaches and for the convenient motorway which now connects it with Lisbon, Faro and even with Spain. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN ><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>8 February 2008<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com/""> www.eptours.com </FONT></A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com/""> www.tedcookson.com </FONT></A></SPAN></SPAN></P>",305

6,6671,"<p>I flew on American Airlines from LAX to MAD airport and spent two nights at the Gran Melia Fenix hotel. I enjoy eating at historic restaurants and this grand city has many to offer. I visited Cafe Comercial (since 1887), Cafe Gijon (since 1888), Casa Labra (since 1860), and Chocolateria San Gines (since 1894). This visit to Madrid was a stop over but my main destination was Tenerife Canary Islands on a tourism board FAM trip. I flew on Iberia Airlines from MAD to TFN airport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MAY2012</p>

<p>Driving in from Toledo, Castilla La Mancha I knew this would be an adventure trying to locate the Melia ME hotel. It was Sunday and the streets were crowded with people enjoying the day. With all the blocked streets and one ways it took us a long time to get to our hotel, worse than London. I was happy to park the car and get to our room, the hotel was great and in a perfect location at plaza Santa Ana. Our room had a view of the plaza where the crowd of people were enjoying their tapas and beer. Driving through Spain we didnt see one American, as for Madrid it was crowded with Americans. We were going to be here for 3 nights and with so much to see we could only pick a few places to visit. The Prado museum is always on our must see list. We enjoyed chocolate and churros at Chocolateria San Gines founded in 1894. On our last night we went to a flamenco show at Casapatas, the show was great but the overpriced food made me sick. Since we were flying business class on Iberia we visited the MAD airport club lounge, and enjoyed some of the great drinks they had displayed. The flight home was very relaxing.<br />

From Paris I flew with Air France into Madrid. Since this was summer time<br />
the flight was full. Being an airline employee they assigned me the jump seat in the cockpit with the pilots. This was the highlight of the trip since my company TWA would never allow this.<br />

Paris is one of the world&#39;s best museum cities, and I have visited Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Mus&eacute;e Rodin, Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay, Mus&eacute;e Jacquemart-Andr&eacute;, Mus&eacute;e National d&#39;Histoire Naturelle, Galerie de Pal&eacute;ontologie et d&rsquo;Anatomie Compar&eacute;e, Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen Age, Mus&eacute;e de l&#39;Orangerie, Mus&eacute;e Marmottan Monet and Centre Pompidou. Paris also offers a wealth of additional interesting sites, some of my favorites being Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re-Lachaise, H&ocirc;tel des Invalides, Les Catacombes, Les Egouts and Deyrolle, established in 1831 and the world&#39;s best taxidermy shop (http://www.deyrolle.com). Paris is also one of the world&#39;s best dining destinations, and I have eaten in most of the historic restaurants, including Le Procope (opened 1686), Polidor (1845), Aux Charpentiers (1856), Brasserie Flo (1860), Bofinger (1864), Brasserie Lipp (1880), Cafe Les Deux Magots (1885), Taverne Henri IV (1885), Brasserie Balzar (1886), Caf&eacute; de Flore (1887), Chartier (1896), Le Vaudeville (1918), L&#39;Ami Louis (1924), Terminus Nord (1925), Allard (1930), Chez Jenny (1930), Taillevent (1946) and Chez George (1964). In May 2012 I stayed at Hotel La Louisiane, which is rundown but well located and was the hotel of choice of many American jazz musicians, like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bud Powell, during the 1940s and early 1950s (http://www.hotel-lalouisiane.com/).</p>

11,111,"<p>November 2018 -- I spent a few days in Amsterdam on my way to Sierra Leone. &nbsp;On my first full day,&nbsp;I took an early train to &#39;s-Hertogenbosch, where the medieval center was relatively unscathed by World War II. Sint-Janskathedraal represents the height of gothic architecture in the Netherlands, but nowadays tourists visit the cathedral to photograph the statue atop one of its buttresses of an angel wearing jeans, holding a pocketbook and using a mobile phone. Den Bosch&rsquo;s other well known statues are of Jheronimus van Aken, born in &lsquo;s-Hertogenbosch so popularly referred to as Hieronymus Bosch, famous for his nightmarish paintings of the underworld, and the gilded Dragon Fountain. &nbsp;On my second day, I took an early train to meet Els Slots to&nbsp;visit the windmill network at Kinderdijk, less than a half hour from where she lives. Around 1740, the Dutch built nineteen windmills to drain water from low-lying land in the village of Kinderdijk, now the largest concentration of historic windmills in the Netherlands. &nbsp;I also revisited&nbsp;the Rijksmuseum&nbsp;and the Van Gogh Museum.</p>

<p>May 2015 -- I visited several World Heritage Sites, including Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis in Utrecht, Droogmakerij de Beemster (Beemster Polder), Ir.D.F. Woudagemaal (D.F. Wouda Steam Pumping Station), Schokland and Surroundings, and the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Muiden Fortress). I also wandered around Amsterdam, where I ate at Haesje Claes, founded in 1974 (http://www.haesjeclaes.nl/), and drank at Caf&eacute; Hoppe, which has been located on the Spui since 1670 (http://cafehoppe.com/).<br />
<br />
August 2003 -- I made a short visit to Amsterdam while traveling from Nairobi to New York and visited the Rijksmuseum.<br />
<br />
November 2001 -- I based myself in Amsterdam, where I stayed at the American Hotel, established in 1900 and well located on Leidseplein. My primary goal was to visit Mauritshuis, an art museum in The Hague that holds three of the 34 works firmly attributed to Johannes Vermeer, including <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> and <em>View of Delft.</em> I also visited Delft, where I stood on the site where <em>View of Delft</em> was painted, Haarlem and Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, the oldest zoo in the Netherlands.<br />
<br />
August 1994 -- I spent several days in Amsterdam, where I visited Anne Frankhuis, Museum Het Rembrandthuis, the Rijksmuseum, one of the world&#39;s great painting museums, and the Van Gogh Museum. Two of my favorite restaurants on this trip were D&#39;Vijff Vlieghen and the Pancake Bakery (http://www.pancake.nl/), and bars were Caf&eacute; Chris, opened in 1624, and Caf&eacute; Hoppe.</p>

6,22488,"<p>Where In the World? Tuesday, July 17, 2012 Partly named after an indigenous cactus, this British overseas territory has jet-setters flocking hither to enjoy one of the finest beaches in all the West Indies and world class diving on coral reefs reaching depths of more than 7,000 feet. Before the jets and as recently as the first hotel opening in 1968, many of the &quot;belongers&rdquo;&nbsp;traced their arrival back to a Spanish slave ship that wrecked ashore in 1844. Traffic was virtually non existent, there being only three vehicles on the island, one of them a bulldozer. It was in one of these other vehicles that Suzie, a newly transplanted hotel manager from New York, would pick up guests from the airport, lining up her headlights with the runway to facilitate approach during night time landings. Today as you make your way into town you might spot a street named &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;&nbsp;and you might just wonder about Suzie and about days long since departed. This extended weekend, in part celebration of the birth of the much beloved Anja Regina and part escape from New York&#39;s urban inferno, I will file this country, this &quot;magic monotony of existence between sky and water&quot; where &quot;aging is optional&rdquo;, #80 under &quot;T&rdquo;&nbsp;between Turkey and Uruguay. - A few days later - By the time you read this I will be high and dry some 30,000 feet over the Bahamas enroute to Atlanta with the fine white powdery beaches of the Providenciales fading quickly in the turquoise waters. It was early Sunday morning when I made my way to the remote and secluded North West Point passing locals dressed in their finest on the way to church services, the tourists still bedridden, recovering from a bout of rum poisoning the night before. I drove several miles along a desolate, rocky dirt road past shrubs and salt ponds over the highest hill until finally reaching Malcom beach. It was here in this bay that Christopher Columbus set anchor and explored the area many, many years ago. I thought I had the entire beach park to myself but spotted a flurry of activity further down near the exclusive Amanyara Resort. Upon closer inspection I found out it&rsquo;s a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret swimsuit photo shoot(they also shot here the year before). I made my into the water to find what other wonderful surprises the reefs might offer. The waters were teaming with fish, and I spotted a Barracuda, with a nice set of sharp teeth, just 10 feet away. As in Hawaii there are public access ways to all the beaches even among the big resorts, however being a British Overseas Territory, the beach up to the high water mark is not owned by the people but rather by, ahem, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. I found &ldquo;Suzie Turn&rdquo;, she now has an entire shopping plaza named after her, and made my way down to the marina where the original hotel, the Turtle Cove Inn, is still accepting guests. Gentle turquoise waters, friendly English speaking locals, reefs full of a diverse aquatic life, and powdery white beaches as soft as cotton candy teaming with supermodels, the Turks and Caicos certainly is &ldquo;beautiful by nature&quot;.</p>

Ruthin Castle is a little more pricey than the places we usually stay, but we made the splurge since it was our honeymoon and it it was worth every penny. We will cherish the memories we made there for the rest of our lives.

This is an authentic mediaeval castle, the oldest remains of which date back to 1277. A short walk from the quaint town centre, it is surrounded by thirty acres of gardens with flowers and peacocks and a flock of sheep. We loved exploring the old walls, dungeons, and passageways.

This is a businessmans hotel and is in a very convenient location. After a visit to the fort Melilla La Vieja we stopped by the tourist office to get a local map. The agent was suprised that we were from Los Angeles and that we had traveled so far. She stated mostly Spaniards come here for vacation and never had Californians in her office. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.<br>People seem to live stress free without the chaos of European Spain. In the evening we went to La Cerveceria tapas bar, a very unique bar with tile everywhere. The beer was good and the tapas even better. Most MTP members seem to rush through this enclave, but we are glad we spent the night to enjoy it at a tranquil pace. The next day we had a taxi driver take us to the border, this was to be our entry point into Morocco through Nador. Melilla is very clean but once you get to the border its dirty. Unemployed Moroccans will offer to fill out the passport entry form and lead you to the entry point. I paid a euro for the help and it was an easy walk through the border, not chaotic at all.

8,1,"Clipperton Island is a remote, uninhabited and barren island 700 miles off the Pacific Coast of Mexico. It is an eerie place, and all who have attempted to settle here have either died, fled, or been driven mad (or some combination of the above). Claimed by France, the island was settled for several years by a Mexican garrison. The story of their subsequent downfall is epic in its drama. During WWII, the US Navy tried and failed to land enough equipment to construct a runway on Clipperton. The island was familiar to the US, since FDR made two fishing trips to the island.Although mainly devoid of scenery, Clipperton is home to abundant bird and sea life. The incessant frightened calls of the nesting boobies drove many visitors mad, as did the ubiquitous beady red-eyed land crabs which hide in the sand during the sunny days, then energe at night to swarm and devour any organic materials they can find. Clipperton is also home to some of the most spectacular tuna fishing in the world. In recent years, it has been visited annually by passenger sportfishing boats out of San Diego, including the Royal Star, Red Rooster, Royal Polaris, and Excel. I visited on the Royal Star, and highly recommend their service, whether or not one is a skilled angler. Landing is difficult, due to the encircling reefs, and the ubiquitous sharks. It is rare that a dinghy can actually land on the beach; the US Navy lost several vessels trying to land during WWII. I had to swim roughly 50M through the surf in order to land, and ruined my camera along the way!",10
5,8018,"Corsica, a rocky island south of France in the Ligurian Sea, is a land known for its independent spirit, rugged beauty, olive oil, citrus fruits and of course as the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Our first glimpse of Corsica revealed a rugged island, with jagged craggy mountains and snow capped peaks.  Yes, snow, even in July, snow could be seen in the uppermost mountains.  Calvi, Corsica was one of the ports we stopped at during a sailing trip on the Star Clipper from Cannes, France to Dubrovnik, Croatia in July of 2006. <br>Approaching Calvi, your eyes are immediately drawn to the most dominant feature in the town -  the citadel.   The citadel is a walled portion of the town which juts into the bay creating a very medieval look to the town.   Legend says that Christopher Columbus was born in Calvi (although most historians disagree) as can be seen in a monument at the approach to the citadel in town.   <br>We anchored in the harbor, and before we decided to go into town, Michael went Scuba Diving off of the walls of the citadel  where the remains of an American B17 bomber lies about 85-90 feet (25-28 meters) below the surface.  The bomber was mostly intact except for it's tail section.  In 1944, the B17 G ""Baron"" was on a mission in Italy. Unfortunately, German fighters hit the Baron. Without any radio, the pilot, Frank Chaplick, flew to Calvi (Corsica, France). The landing strip was too short, so he decided to land on the sea. <br>At lunch time, we took the tender into Calvi.  Starting off the afternoon, we ate a marvelous lunch in one of the many restaurants situated on the marina.  The marina, is a palm lined harbor on the waterfront with hoards of umbrella covered restaurant tables which of course feature French and Italian food, but with a Mediterranean flare.  After lunch we set off to explore the town. <br>We wandered the lower part of the town, looking through shops, parks and the like before deciding to set our sites upward.   To explore the citadel, we entered by way of Place Cristophe Colomb, named of course for that intrepid explorer.  It was hot, but we continued to wind our way around the walls taking in many of the breathtaking views of the town and harbor.  This was made much more fun in that the town within the citadel walls is not filled with tourist shops.  In fact you can only find a few shops and restaurants in the citadel.  The rest of the buildings include homes, the Governor's Palace, a couple of churches and loads of narrow, winding, empty streets.   We were amazed to find that the old town was peaceful and quiet, even in July, the height of tourist season.  At the top of the citadel you will find the Cathedral Saint-Jean Baptiste, a 13th century church (destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1570) where you can rest and pray for a few moments before descending back to the town. <br>After some wandering and shopping, we returned to the ship, having spent a peaceful day (although it was quite hot) in a sleepy little town called Calvi.  We would love to return to Corsica and explore it someday.  Perhaps it will be sooner than we think since some of our good friends are from Corsica and often spend summers back in their homeland.",251

Everyone was heading to Pamplona for the San Fermin festival or as we call it the Running of the Bulls. We had some unexpected guests come into our cabin in the form of young gypsies who hid under the seats. They were hiding because they had no tickets and the ticket takers would throw them off the train. The rail employees ended up catching some of the gypsies and taking them off the train. The gypsies were slick, all they did was run to the next car and get back on the train again.

In September 2016, I visited Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe WHS in Kassel on a Wednesday, one of two days each week when visitors can see the water features in action and follow the water from the Hercules monument to the Grand Fountain.",809
383,111,"February 2005 -- I took the train from Hamburg  Hauptbahnhof to the Hanseatic City of Lübeck, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  I had lunch at Schiffergesellschaft, considered to be one of the oldest pubs in the world (http://www.schiffergesellschaft.com/).",817
501,111,"February 2005, August 2006 and September 2016 -- I have stayed at several hotels in Hamburg, including the Hotel Monopol on Reeperbahn; Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten, founded in 1897 and well located on the western side of the Inner Alster Lake shore (http://www.fairmont.com/vier-jahreszeiten-hamburg/); and Reichshof Hamburg, which was built in 1910 and is located near the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof.  On each of my trips, I visited some of the Beatles-related sites, including Gretel & Alfons, one of the few Beatles-visited pubs still in operation (http://www.gretelundalfons.de/).  I have also visited Tierpark Hagenbeck, known for being the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages (http://www.hagenbeck.de/startseite.html), and the Speicherstadt and Kontorhaus District with Chilehaus UNESCO World Heritage Site.",808
390,111,"February 2008 -- I flew to Saba from St. Maarten on Winair (http://www.fly-winair.com/) and visited Windwardside, where I had lunch at Scout's Place, which offers clear views over the island (http://www.sabadivers.com/english/bar_restaurant.htm).  Saba is the smallest island of the Netherlands Antilles, but contains the highest point of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.",206

1,35,"First of all, I like traveling to any place where they speak Portugese, which in my opinion is the most beautiful language in the world.  My wife and I visited Portugal and the Azores in October 2005 and had a blast!  Lisbon is one of the great capitals of Europe.  The views from Lisbon's many hills are breathtaking although I must say I was a little put off by all of the graffitti.  We also visited the quaint village of Sintra, the amazing walled Renaissance town of Evora and the stunning Algarve coast in Southern Portugal.  Highlights included the delicious food and drink I had throughout Portugal including the interestingly paired, but incredibly tasty pork and clams, sardinhas asados, arroz con mariscos, vinho verde and of course Portugal's most famous wine . . . Port!  We also had an amazing time hiking up a mountain to Sintra's Palace and Moorish Castle and wandering the cobblestoned streets of Evora.  Finally, we relaxed on the sun-drenched beaches and coves of the Algarve . . . which to me evoked images of both the brilliant red-rock Bryce Canyon and the azure waters of the Mediterranean.  We explored the beautiful Algarve from our base in Lagos and while there, made it out to Cabo Sao Vicente (the most southwestern point of Europe).  One day I plan to return to Portugal and head north from Lisbon to Obidos, Coimbra and the famous Duoro Valley.",305
0,13093,"Flew into and spent a couple days in Athens. Met up with a local friend and checked out some clubs in the Technopolis area of the city. Rented a car and headed South to the cities of Nafplion, Gythio, and Sparta. This southern peninsular region of Greece was my favorite of the country. This is where all the roadside stops and hidden wonders are discovered. Larissa Castle, the sprawling orange groves and the Mythras ruins are unforgettable. We were there in the off season and most everything was empty of other tourists. Returning to Athens, we boarded an overnight ferry to Heraklion, Crete. Again a car was rented and we drove into the mountains of Crete, topping out at Mt. Ida, and the legendary cave where the baby Zeus was hidden and raised. We caught another ferry and sailed from the Eastern end of the island to Santorini. Rent ATV's and tour the island on your terms. You're able to drive on the highways and even the beaches. ",270
182,6671,"From Berlin we drove through Saxony Anhalt into Lower Saxony. My favorite automobile is Volkswagen so I made plans to visit the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg. We spent the night at the Tryp Wolfsburg hotel and off I went to the factory. The Autostadt Wolfsburg is a huge facility housing everything VW, old and new. I am more interested in the old so I took many photos of the split window beetles and barn door kombis. For a VW fanatic this place is heaven. I also visited the AutoMuseum Volkswagen which has a nice collection of antique VWs and rare models. The next day we drove back to Berlin. ",810
203,6671,"From Madrid we headed for El Escorial, but we knew it would be closed because it was Monday. We just wanted to be there in its grandeur, and we also were going to Segovia. We went back to visit the Alcazar, aquaduct and the cathedral just as we did in 1999. This city deserves more than just a day trip. <br><br>DEC1999<br>From Madrid we drove our rental car to see the Alcazar in Segovia, Aquaduct and the Cathedral. The area was very impressive and we spent one night at the Hostal Residencia Plaza. Our next stop was Toledo. ",839
76,6671,From Merida Spain we drove through Badajoz to Elvas. We arrived during siesta and hardly anyone was around. It seemed we were the only tourists here also. We entered a cafe where locals were enjoying some cold beer. This was a nice place to stop and Elvas had a few historical places to visit. After a brief visit we drove north to Portalegre and back into Spain. <br><br>DEC1999<br>We departed from Ayamonte Spain we drove into Portugal. It seemed that only olive trees were the only thing we were going to see on our whole trip. We finally got to Beja and spent the night at the pension Santa Barbara and enjoyed a meal at restaurant O Aficionado. On our way we continued to see castles and old bridges and no other tourists. Once we arrived in Lisbon we continued driving and spent the night in Sintra. The place we stayed at was the two star Hotel Central and from here we enjoyed walking around the city. Of course we had to visit the Pena Palace the main attraction in Sintra. Since it was winter there was hardly any tourists here and we felt we had Sintra to ourselves. We enjoyed good food and local wine at low prices. After leaving Sintra we drove to Cascais and then back to Lisbon where we spent the night at the Quality Hotel Lisboa. We flew on Trans World Airlines back to New York JFK then back home to LAX.,305
156,6671,"From Milan I flew to Rome on Alitalia Airlines. I started here to continue my adventure to Naples and came back to Rome. I returned to Hotel Sandy which is actually a hostel on Via Cavour. On this vacation I stopped to have coffee at the Caffe Greco established in 1760. I went to revisit the usual popular places such as the Spanish steps, Fountain de Trevi, Pantheon, Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II, and the Vatican. When I left I went to the Rome Termini and took the train to FCO airport. Since I worked for TWA airlines I was lucky and got first class to New York JFK airport. <br><br><br><br>MAR1994<br>This was the first place I visited when I first visited Europe.

I went to so many churches I would never be able to remember all their names. This city will always be in my mind since it was the first place I visited in Europe and got me addicted to traveling. I used Rome as my base and took side trips by train to Naples Campania and Venice Veneto. Since I was in Rome I took the short bus ride to the Vatican City. ",899
138,6671,"From Munich I took a train to Stuttgart to see if I can get into the Porsche factory. The Porsche car factory is very small and only a few tourists are allowed at a time to visit the inside. At first the receptionist could not get me in, but I pleaded with her that I came all the way from California to see the inside of the factory. Since I was only one person she gave me a pass to go inside. I can see why the cars are so expensive as everything is made by hand and not assembled by automated machines. Even though Porsches are made in mass, the 911 models are still hand crafted. I was very glad to have seen this in person and had also seen the prototype black primered Boxster race through the parking lot. After this visit I went to see the Mercedes Benz museum, but there was no one allowed to see the cars being made. My next stop was Heidelberg where I stayed at the Hotel Garni Am Kornmarkt. This is such a nice tranquil city, I visited the castle and other various historical places. Since Heidelberg has the oldest brewery I had to go. The oldest existing brewery in the world is the Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan where beer is produced since 1040. My next city was Frankfurt am Main Hesse where I arrived by train. ",803
0,10544,"Highlights: Lecce (a Baroque confection), Alberobello (where you can see the conical-roofed trulli), Locorotonda (the pale local sandstone gives the old town a lovely glow), Gallipoli (go before noon to the fishermen mend their nets all around the harbor), Squinzano (a small town with a lovely main square where a faded image of Mussolini still appears on one of the buildings) the Negroamaro wines, Trani (a gorgeous port with an austerely beautiful cathedral, fishing and pleasure boats in the capacious harbor, and a spectacular public garden by the sea), and of course the very unique Castel del Monte.

Less interesting: Bari, the capital. While I met many warm and friendly residents, Bari is still pretty gritty place and Bari\'s Centro Storico is to be avoided during siesta when the shops are closed.  I was mugged at 3 in the afternoon; fortunately, the thief was unarmed (and ultimately unsuccessful, but not without a fight.)",893

HELENA ISLAND:<BR><BR>""St. Helena Sightseeing and a Surprise,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2006 </P><P>With Captain Christopher Turner at the helm, Holland America Line's elegant MS <I>Prinsendam</I> slowly approached the anchorage in James Bay off the north coast of the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic on the morning of 14 November 2006 after a 66-hour crossing from Luderitz, Namibia. As it eased to a stop and dropped anchor, the 38,000-ton <I>Prinsendam</I> passed the much smaller, 6,700-ton RMS <I>St. Helena</I>, which already lay at anchor closer to shore. The royal mail ship is the only vessel which regularly links the British overseas territories of St. Helena and Ascension with Walvis Bay, Namibia and Cape Town. <BR><BR>Discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese navigator Joao da Nova and briefly occupied twice by the Dutch during the seventeenth century, St. Helena has been in English possession continuously since 1673. At that time the English East India Company used the island as a stop on the voyage to India via the Cape of Good Hope. In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte was brought to St. Helena and detained there until his death in 1821. The island was also used for the detention of some 5,000 Boer prisoners during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. The economy of St. Helena prospered when the island was used as a port of call for ships plying the route to India and the Cape Colonies. However, the construction of the Suez Canal reduced the frequency of such long sea voyages. Since World War II the prosperity of the island has continued to decrease. However, there are now plans afoot to build an airport on St. Helena in order to help boost the island's economy. Currently it is hoped that the new airport will open by 2012. <BR><BR>At 10 a.m. the <I>Prinsendam</I>, Holland America's oldest (built in 1988) and smallest (793 passengers) liner, commenced tender operations from the ship to the Jamestown wharf. Our touring party that day consisted of a dozen Americans. Most members of our group had embarked in Lisbon on 17 October for the entire 46-day ""Taste of Two Continents"" cruise to Ft. Lauderdale via Cape Town. Prior to St. Helena the <I>Prinsendam</I> had called at a dozen ports in ten African countries from Morocco to South Africa. <BR><BR>After stepping ashore at the Jamestown pier our party was met by Tracey Corker. Tracey and her amiable father Colin operate Corkers Tourist Services. Colin's father had imported one of the first vehicles into St. Helena in the early 1930s. That 1929 Chevrolet Charrabanc, an open touring car which had been manufactured for export in the U. S. with right-hand drive, is still in good running order today; and it can hold up to 16 passengers. Our party had pre-arranged a full-day island tour in Colin's unique green car which is well known on the island. Colin's father had installed a convertible cover for use in rainy weather. The occasional heavy mist we experienced in the uplands that day, said to be unusual for St. Helena in late spring, made use of the convertible cover necessary for awhile. <BR><BR>Our St. Helena sightseeing tour began with a group photo in the Chevy Charrabanc on Main Street in Jamestown. Then, with Colin at the wheel, we proceeded to drive up Side Path, the steep single-lane switchback road carved into the eastern side of the narrow ravine in which Jamestown is located. Colin kept the throttle in low gear for the entire uphill climb as the road rises nearly 600 meters (2,000 feet) in only about 3 km (2 miles). <BR><BR>Our first lengthy stop was made about half an hour later near Napoleon's fenced but inscriptionless tomb. After a 10-minute walk down a wide path we reached the spot at the head of Sane Valley where Napoleon had originally been interred at his death in 1821 after six years in residence on the island. Napoleon's remains were removed to Paris in 1840. I found that the tomb site had been much improved since my first visit to St. Helena in March 2001. Whereas previously a simple grassy area had surrounded the tomb, now there is a well-manicured garden off to one side. The French tricolor continues to fly from a short flagpole near the guard's kiosk. This spot and Longwood House, our next stop, were ceded to France in 1858. <BR><BR>The grounds of Longwood House, Napoleon's residence on St. Helena, were as beautiful as ever. Napoleon's sunken garden pathways, on which he could stroll without being seen from afar, remain in evidence. However, I found that Longwood House had been changed in one important respect since my last visit. While the entrance on the east side of the building is unchanged, the exit is no longer through the long green trellis on the same side. Now visitors can only leave via a gift shop on the north side of the house. The gift shop, which bears the sign of Hutt's Gate Store on the wall behind the counter, offers every sort of Napoleon-related souvenir imaginable, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. But, since Longwood House still has no entrance fee, one can hardly complain. Non-flash photography is allowed in the house but video photography is not. <BR><BR>From Longwood House we returned back to the island's circular road. En route we passed Hutt's Gate Store. Once an inn frequented by Napoleon's guards, Colin mentioned that currently the store is up for auction. <BR><BR>The interior one-third of St. Helena is foliated and resembles England. Southeast trade winds carry mists which shroud the highest slopes and help create lush uplands. During our tour around the island Colin pointed out a couple of disused flax mills. The flax industry was established on St. Helena in the early years of the twentieth century. New Zealand flax, said to grow best on St. Helena's highest ground, was baled and exported to England and South Africa where it was made into hemp. However, the flax industry collapsed in the mid-1960s when the British General Post Office began to employ nylon rather than hemp manufactured from St. Helena-grown flax. <BR> <BR>As the afternoon wore on, our party paused en route at the Solomon & Co. shop at Silver Hill for some refreshments of candy and cookies. Fifteen minutes later we passed Sandy Bay, which forms part of a large sunken crater. Unfortunately foggy conditions made it difficult to discern Lot and Lot's Wife, two giant basalt pillars which jut up from the lunar landscape in the south of the island. The beautiful vistas of the blue sea beyond the island's arid coast were also obscured by the fog and mist. During our tour Colin pointed out three new senior citizens' residences which have been constructed by the government in recent years at various places around the island. <BR><BR>Later we passed St. Paul's Cathedral. St. Helena is a bishopric in the province of the Church of South Africa, and most of St. Helena's remaining inhabitants are Anglican. Since winning the right of abode in the United Kingdom the island's population has shrunk somewhat. Colin thought that the current population is probably in the range of 3,500 whereas St. Helena's population had been as high as 6,000 in the past.<br><br>Our next stop was at Plantation House, the home of St. Helena 's governors since 1792.  While it is thought that several other houses preceded the current house, the locations of these earlier houses are unknown.  The first such governor's house may have been built of wood as early as 1673.  The present site of Plantation House was provided by the East India Company. <br><br>Plantation House's Georgian facade faces onto a wide fenced lawn which is home to at least five giant tortoises ranging in weight from 55 kg. (121 pounds) to approximately 200 kg. (440 pounds).  We photographed Jonathan, the Seychelles tortoise who was brought to St. Helena as a mature adult in 1882.  Based on the assumption that a tortoise is mature when it is about 50 years of age, Jonathan's current age has been estimated at approximately 174.  Jonathan is said to be the oldest known member of his species, Testudinipae cytodira .  Jonathan lives on the grounds along with David, Emma, Fredricka andMyrtle.  These other four giant tortoises have joined Jonathan on the lawn of Plantation House only since the late 1960s.  While occasionally eggs are laid by the female tortoises, none has ever produced offspring. <br><br>From Plantation House we drove down to the Jamestown suburb long known at Half Tree Hollow.  Colin mentioned that nowadays locals most often refer to this area as Three Tanks after the three red water tanks currently in use there.  From that point we continued down to Ladder Hill in order to photograph Jamestown far below.  Jacob's Ladder, with 699 almost-vertical steps, is said to be the longest staircase in the world.  It was built by the Royal Engineers in 1829 to link Jamestown with High Knoll Fort, situated on the cliff above. <br><br>Our party's island tour concluded in front of the post office on Main Street in Jamestown; and it was there and then that I had long planned a special surprise for Barbara Stein, my significant other of nine years.  Barbara and I have considered ourselves a couple almost since we met when we sat next to each other on a bus during a travel agents' tour of Iran in 1997.  As avid and frequent travelers to exotic places, Barbara and I have often joked privately of marrying at the South Pole.  But we both knew that in reality only a winning lottery ticket ever would have made that possible.  We also knew that, because a wedding far from the U. S. would make it difficult for friends and family to attend, South Florida is the most logical place for the wedding itself.  <br><br>During the spring of 2006 it occurred to me that the only way to add an exotic geographical component to our marriage would be for me to propose to Barbara at some distant locale.  Since our Holland America Lisbon-to-Ft. Lauderdale cruise via Cape Town had been anticipated since mid-2005, I determined to propose to Barbara on November 14 on the steps of the main post office in Jamestown.  Because I wanted to surprise her, I told Barbara nothing about the engagement ring I had made for her in Cairo in the summer of 2006.  However, I did inform our friends who were to tour with us in St . Helena.  Unbeknownst to me, they proceeded to purchase and then sneak two bottles of champagne, plastic cups, and confetti along on the tour that day.   <br><br>At the end of our island tour I assembled our party of 12 for a group photo on the steps of the Jamestown post office.  Afterward I employed the ruse of asking Barbara to pose with me for a separate photo in order to separate her from the rest of the group.  It was then that I got down on my knee on the step of the post office and slipped an alexandrite engagement ring onto her finger, asking if she would marry me in November 2007.  Uncharacteristically, a flabbergasted Barbara appeared to find herself at a complete loss for words.  However, she soon gave me a positive response; and then bubbly was poured for all.  As it was late in the day and there were no customers, even the three ladies working in the main post office, all of whom had been watching from behind the counter inside, joined us in celebrating! <br><br>Before leaving the premises I posted a couple of dozen postcards at the post office.  I was told that my cards would be carried on the RMS St. Helena , which was scheduled to depart on 15 November for Cape Town.  A notice outside the post office cautioned that 14 November was the deadline for posting surface mail to the U. K. before Christmas. <br><br>For the convenience of cruise passengers, on 16 November the St. Helena Development Agency sponsored a trade fair.  Over a dozen vendors set up stands in the small park between the moat and the side of the Castle, just to the east of the Archway at the entrance to Jamestown.  Items offered for sale included the following:  locally-produced Tungi wine; locally-grown coffee; canned tuna fish from the St. Helena Cannery; embroidery and crocheted articles; tea towels; shoulder bags; shopping bags; aprons; T-shirts; caps; mugs; calendars; cookbooks; jams; pressed flower pictures; woodcraft items; post cards; a DVD about the island; and a CD by a local artist. <br><br>After our eight-hour call at St. Helena the Prinsendam continued on to Ascension Island and four Brazilian ports plus Barbados and the Bahamas before finishing the cruise in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  Unfortunately on 16 November a heavy swell and strong winds made tendering into Georgetown too dangerous.  So instead Captain Turner elected to circumnavigate Ascension before MS Prinsendam proceeded on the 73-hour passage to Fortaleza, Brazil. <BR><BR><BR>Ted Cookson<BR>Manager - Maadi<BR>Egypt Panorama Tours<BR>Cairo, Egypt<BR>22 April 2007<BR> <A href=""http://www.eptours.com"">www.eptours.com </A><BR><A href=""http://www.tedcookson.com"">www.tedcookson.com </A></P><br>",232
44,23,"HOW TO GET TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P>British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is most easily reached by yacht charter from the Maldives. However, some travelers have also sailed to BIOT by yacht charter from the Seychelles. The sailing time to BIOT from Seychelles is substantially longer than what is required from Gan (Addu Atoll) in the Maldives. </P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY:</P><P >""A Travelers Century Club Expedition to Remote British Indian Ocean Territory,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in December 2002<BR> <BR>Membership in the Travelers Century Club (TCC), organized in Los Angeles in 1954 by a group of the worlds most widely traveled people, is limited to those who have visited 100 or more of the 317 destinations on the clubs list.<BR><BR>One of the most remote of those destinations is British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Formerly called the Oil Islands (oil refers to copra, or coconut oil, rather than to petroleum), BIOT consists of the Chagos Archipelago. Lying south of the Republic of the Maldives, BIOT consists of a number of atolls, the most southerly and the best known of which is Diego Garcia, where some of the U. S. aircraft employed in Afghanistan were based. In the northern reaches of BIOT are the Salomon Islands, which I visited by yacht 21-22 July 2002.<BR><BR>Our yacht charter was organized by club member Charles Veley who was attempting to visit the entire TCC list within a period of 15 months. Charles, in his mid-30s, also planned to be the youngest person to visit every destination on the TCC list. Charles had already found two others to share the steep yacht charter expenses, Jeff Shea and Ben Fogle. Jeff is another TCC member who is also an accomplished mountain climber. Ben Fogle, while not a TCC member, is a BBC travel show presenter who is writing a book on far-flung British overseas territories. (There may also eventually be a parallel BBC television program.)<BR><BR>On 17 July I flew Emirates from Cairo to the Maldives via Dubai. Upon arrival on the morning of 18 July I hopped a motorized ferry from the airport island across to Male, the capital, which is situated on a nearby island. Then early on the morning of 19 July we flew to Gan in a 15-passenger twin engine plane. <BR><BR>Upon arrival at Gan the four of us were met by two sedan cars which carried us a short distance to a spot where we could board a small motorboat to go out to our 94-foot sailing yacht, the Dream Voyager. Due to the peculiar geography of the Maldives, which consists of many small atolls, cars are rather uncommon. But during the British presence at Gan between 1957 and 1976 some 10 miles of road had been built at Addu Atoll by joining together several adjacent islands with causeways.<BR><BR>After customs clearance we finally set sail on the evening of 19 July in Dream Voyager south from Addu Atoll en route to the Salomon Islands in BIOT. We were sailing against a strong southeasterly wind, and the water was choppy. Although I was wearing an ear patch, I didn't feel like eating much for dinner. But I definitely felt better after losing lunch later that evening.<BR><BR>Our accommodations on the air-conditioned Dream Voyager were excellent. Each of us had his own bedroom with private sink, shower and toilet. The yacht carried a crew of eight, including an international captain. Due to Maldives maritime regulations, one captain had been required for the domestic journey from Male, from where the yacht had originally sailed with crew only; and we required a second captain for our international journey which began at Gan.<BR><BR>We sailed south all day on 20 July. Then on the morning of 21 July land was sighted. We could see the low-lying Salomon Islands atoll on the horizon. All of the islands are covered with a dense forest of coconut palms. About two hours later we sailed into the horseshoe-shaped atoll which opens to the north. We then turned right and dropped anchor off Boddam Island, one of ten islands in the atoll. The crossing had taken us about 40 hours.<BR><BR>The atolls of what is now BIOT used to fall under the political control of Mauritius. Then in the early 1970s the various islands were sterilized. The people living on Boddam Island and on other atolls in the Chagos Archipelago - about 2,000 in total - were ""compensated"" and shipped off to Mauritius. I heard that the dogs living on one of the islands were all gassed. BIOT was declared to be an independent political entity in 1972. The sterilization procedures apparently fulfilled the terms of an agreement under which the U. S. in 1972 took over Diego Garcia from the U. K. on a long-term lease. The British coast guard still patrols the waters of BIOT, and U. S. military personnel occupy only the large atoll of Diego Garcia with its air base in the far south.<BR><BR>The ""Ilois,"" people who had been removed from the Chagos Archipelago, recently won a court case against the U. K. This court decision will allow them to return to their former homes on Boddam Island and elsewhere in BIOT. We heard that a boat carrying a few of these islanders would soon be arriving in the Salomon Islands in order to check out the current situation there.<BR><BR>We landed on a pristine sandy beach on the northeast side of the still uninhabited Boddam Island on the morning of 21 July. Before I left Cairo I had commissioned the painting of a cloth banner which read, ""Travelers Century Club - BIOT 2002."" After taking photos of ourselves holding that banner, we began to explore, traversing the width of the island on a well-marked path. The western side of Boddam - without the protection of the atoll - offered rougher water and a much narrower beach with both sand and rocks.<BR><BR>Boddam Island contains the remains of a copra plantation. The old warehouse is connected to the dock bynarrow gauge railway tracks. The cement and coral walls of the buildings remain but some of the roofs have decayed. One of the old building stones bore the inscription, ""Cowen - England."" There is also a graveyard where headstones bear inscriptions dating back to the 1800s.<BR><BR>There are a church and a number of residential buildings. The latter, made of corrugated metal, still stand with their roofs intact. The interiors of some of the buildings have been spray painted with the names of yachts and yachters who have visited in recent years. One such yachter graffito, for instance, reads, ""Against all odds - Andy & Margaux, Australia 2001 - Love to live, live to love.""<BR><BR>We overnighted off Boddam Island along with a dozen or so other yachts which were anchored in the Salomons. This atoll serves as a way station for yachts crossing the Indian Ocean. For a $70 fee yachts are allowed to anchor for several months. Having chatted with a few of the yachters on Boddam, we learned that some yachters sail to BIOT, stay up to six months, and then simply return again after resupplying in Malaysia or Thailand. With E-mail available nowadays via short wave, yachters can easily stay in touch with the outside world even from somewhere as remote as BIOT.<BR><BR>Yachters sometimes congregate on Boddam Island in the evening in order to barbecue and socialize, and perhaps once a month the British coast guard sponsors a barbecue for all yachters present. There is a volleyball court, a swing made from rope and a half of a coconut shell and even a picnic table.<BR><BR>Although fishing is allowed in BIOT, diving is not.

He commented that, if we had any dive tanks on board, he didn't want to see them.

He was also charged with inspecting these vessels.<BR><BR>On the afternoon of 22 July we rode our yacht's small motorboat from our anchorage near Boddam Island around the rest of the atoll.

Before returning to our own yacht across the lagoon, we halted to swim and snorkel at the site where another yacht had recently sunk. The sunken yacht's two white masts rose at an awkward angle out of the blue green waters of the Salomon Islands lagoon. We could see that a PC and other personal belongings were still aboard the sunken yacht, which bore a hole in its fiberglass hull.<BR><BR>Arriving back on the Dream Voyager, we found a Frenchman and his daughter from another yacht on board our own yacht sipping tea with our crew.

12,23,"HOW TO GET TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:</P><P><!--StartFragment -->Normally about half a dozen cruise ships call at Pitcairn annually. However, only occasionally do any of these cruise ships ever land passengers on the island. When this does happen, it is almost always one of the islanders' longboats which is used to transport people ashore. Yacht charters to Pitcairn are possible from Mangareva in French Polynesia. These charters can be arranged via an agent in the U. S. Finally, supply vessels visit Pitcairn on an irregular basis, either from Mangareva or once in awhile from New Zealand. It might be possible to purchase passage on one of these sailings.</P><P><BR>MY VISIT TO PITCAIRN ISLAND:<BR><BR>""A Visit to Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific,"" written for the expatriate community in Cairo, Egypt by Ted Cookson in February 2003 </P><P>On 25 January 2003 I sailed from Valparaiso, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on the 513-passenger German-registered cruise ship MS Deutschland. During the 16-day cruise the Deutschland called at Chile's Robinson Crusoe Island, Easter Island and Pitcairn Island as well as Fakarava and Moorea in French Polynesia. On 4 February I landed at Pitcairn in smooth seas and got to explore that island for half a day. <BR><BR>I had first attempted to land at Pitcairn during a previous cruise on the Deutschland in August 2000. However, that attempt was frustrated by a 3-meter sea swell. No passengers were allowed to disembark from the Deutschland that time. Then in November 2002 during a second Pitcairn attempt aboard the Seven Seas Navigator I did manage to land. But because passengers were recalled to the ship after only 20 minutes, I never had a chance to explore anything but Pitcairn's dock area. <BR><BR>I have been fascinated by faraway Pitcairn Island for nearly 40 years. In the early 1960s as a young teenager I read Nordhoff and Hall's Bounty Trilogy novels (Mutiny on the Bounty, Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island) and began collecting Pitcairn Island postage stamps. <BR><BR>One of the most remote of the world's inhabited islands, Pitcairn lies in the South Pacific Ocean roughly midway between Tahiti and Easter Island. Pitcairn Island is 4,155 nautical miles (nm) southwest of Los Angeles, 3,504 nm northwest of Santiago, Chile and 3,314 nm northeast of Wellington, New Zealand. Pitcairn is 11,281 nm from Cairo.<BR><BR>Pitcairn was discovered in 1767 by a midshipman named Pitcairn aboard HMS Swallow, but the island was not settled until 1790 when Fletcher Christian and his band of mutineers arrived aboard the Bounty. In a tale immortalized on film by Clark Gable and Charles Laughton (1934), Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard (1962) and Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (1984), Fletcher Christian seized the Bounty from Captain William Bligh and eventually steered it to Pitcairn Island.<BR><BR>The Bounty had sailed from England in 1787 on a mission to gather breadfruit trees in Polynesia and transport them to the British West Indies where, it was thought, breadfruit would provide a new, cheap source of food for slaves on the sugar plantations. After ten months and 27,000 nm of sailing, the Bounty finally arrived in Tahiti. During the five months which the ship remained in Tahiti while young breadfruit trees were cultivated, many of the crew became captivated by the local women. <BR><BR>The famous mutiny on the Bounty took place some 3 1/2 weeks into the sail from Tahiti westward toward the West Indies. Bligh and 18 loyal crew were set adrift in a longboat. Against all odds nearly all of these men eventually reached Dutch-held Timor (Indonesia) after a 3,600-nm open boat voyage. Meanwhile, Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers returned to Tahiti for their women. After leaving behind at Tahiti 16 men who wished to remain, nine mutineers and their women plus nine other Polynesian men and women roamed the Pacific for several months in search of an island on which they could hide. Eventually Fletcher Christian sailed the Bounty to Pitcairn which, fortunately, had been charted incorrectly by 200 miles. There the Bounty was burned to hide all evidence of the mutineers' arrival.<BR><BR>Most of the 50 current inhabitants of Pitcairn are descendants of the original Bounty mutineers and the Polynesians who accompanied them. Some of the others are descendants of shipwrecked sailors who decided to remain on the island and marry.<BR><BR>The Pitcairn Islands, which consist of Pitcairn plus the uninhabited Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, are today administered as a British colony via an administrative headquarters in New Zealand. Pitcairn's island council handles such local affairs as island maintenance, postal and medical services and communications. Pitcairn's chief source of income derives from the sale of postage stamps to collectors. <BR><BR>About one mile wide and two miles long, Pitcairn is of volcanic origin. The highest point on the island is some 1,100 feet. The land is hilly but fertile; and the islanders grow sweet potatoes, yams, pineapples, cabbages, beans, tomatoes, citrus and bananas. There are no farm animals, although poultry and wild goats exist on the island. <BR><BR>Pitcairn is completely surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs. There is only one small harbor, at Bounty Bay. Access to this harbor is via longboat operated by the islanders. A longboat carries about two dozen passengers on an open deck. Even in calm seas getting into and out of a Pitcairn longboat while it is alongside a cruise ship can be challenging. The longboat bobs up and down with the waves, so the timing of one's step is everything. On my previous landing at Pitcairn I had to climb down a rope ladder and then jump ""blind"" into a longboat when instructed to do so by the crew. Luckily this time the Deutschland employed an external stairway. But even the slight sea swell still made the step into the longboat an exciting one. <BR><BR>Upon landing on the island, I first had my photograph taken in front of the ""Welcome to Pitcairn Island"" sign above the boathouse. The next order of business was climbing the so-called Hill of Difficulty to reach the small settlement of Adamstown, named for the last surviving mutineer. One of the Bounty anchors is displayed in the small town square. Facing the square are the post office, the courthouse, the museum, the library and a Seventh Day Adventist church. In the church is one of the original Bounty bibles. <BR><BR>I was fortunate to be offered a tour of the entire island in an open all-terrain vehicle. The first stop was on a hilltop called Ship Landing Point overlooking Bounty Bay from where I could view Adamstown. Above the settlement is a large cave where Fletcher Christian maintained a watch out over the sea. <BR><BR>Then we drove to St. Paul's Point. Directly below, islanders can enjoy an ocean swim in a pool which is afforded protection by large boulders. On the way we passed a very steep trail leading to ""Down Rope."" There on the cliff face are inscribed Polynesian petroglyphs. From these markings and a few stone tools found on the island it is known that Polynesians visited Pitcairn long before the arrival of the Bounty mutineers. <BR><BR>My tour continued to Tautama where I saw wild goats grazing. Then we drove to Taro Ground where the radio station is situated. Ham radio enthusiasts from around the world are ever eager to make contact with remote Pitcairn. We went on to the highest point on the island, and from there we drove down Garnet's Ridge back to Adamstown. On the way I took in views of beautiful uninhabited ""Tedside."" This term is apparently a corruption of the phrase ""the other side.""<BR><BR>Back in Adamstown, I visited the schoolhouse. A school teacher from New Zealand is posted to the island on a two-year contract. I also saw the unoccupied and delapidated house of Thursday October Christian, Fletcher Christian's first son, who died in 1866. Nearby is the cemetery which contains gravestones dating back to the nineteenth century. <BR><BR>On the way back to the longboat I stopped at The Edge which overlooks Bounty Bay. There rests the anchor of the Acadia, one of the many ships which has foundered in the Pitcairn Islands over the years. The Acadia ran aground at Ducie Island in 1881. The anchor was raised and carried to Pitcairn in 1990.<BR><BR>While I had been exploring Pitcairn during the morning, about 35 islanders had come aboard the Deutschland to sell their wooden handicrafts, woven baskets, T-shirts and postage stamps. So after a quick lunch I shopped for wooden turtles, my favorite Pitcairn handicraft. I also purchased a large model of a Pitcairn longboat.<BR><BR>During afternoon tea three of the islanders were interviewed in the ship's auditorium. Then it was time for the Pitcairners to bid us goodbye. As they sailed away in their longboat, the islanders looked up at the ship's passengers crowded along the railings and sang us a farewell song. <BR> <BR>For further information about the Mutiny on the Bounty saga and about Pitcairn Island, visit <A href=""http://www.lareau.org/"" eudora=""autourl"">www.lareau.org</A>, which contains many useful links.

Those fascinated by the Pitcairn story will also be interested in Norfolk Island, situated between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia.

From Pitcairn, we sailed to Henderson and Ducie Islands (successful landings) and now back to Pitcairn.

The weather was nice and enjoyed the hospitality of the locals. I visited Amalfi, Sorrento, Positano, Ravello, and Capri. Parking space is very limited here, so owning an automobile is probably more hassle than its worth. I bought locally made ceramic tile and tried the limoncello liquor that everyone seems to sell. The sunsets were beautiful here and couldnt believe the locals didnt bother to stand still for a moment and watch this spectacle. I guess they are used to seeing these beautiful sunsets everyday.

Highlights were Lake Goto Mere with it\'s numerous pink flamingos, and the Washington Slagbaai National Park. Coming back to Kralendijk, we still had time to take an unguided walking tour of the city, with its quaint colorful buildings, Government House, Customs House, historic Fort Oranje, and other interesting sites.

Travel to Anguilla was by a short ferry ride from nearby St. Martin, and departure was via Liat airlines, first back to Sint Maarten, then onward to Dominica.  This was one leg in a 30 day tour to 11 Caribbean nations, from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Isla Margarita in Venezuela.

I arrived in Anguilla without a reservation, hailed a taxi at the docks, and asked the driver if he would recommend an inexpensive place to stay.  He took me to Lloyd\'s Guest House and Beach Apartments, located on Crocus Hill and a short walk from the very beautiful Crocus Bay.  Price for the room included meals, served family style around a big table.  One of the most enjoyable factors in my stay in Anguilla was chatting around the table with the eclectic assortment of other guests who were from various places around the world.

During my three days on Anguilla, I enjoyed hanging out some at an open air café on Crocus Bay, and also spent several hours walking about the island, immersing myself in the rural ambiance of the island which appeared to have very little tourist infrastructure at the time.",179

We chose to rent a car and in a way I was amazed that the rental agency didn\'t even ask me if I knew how to drive on the left side of the street.  Actually, my only experience in doing so before  had been in Trinidad and Tobago several years earlier.  

We drove first to Cambridge, where we visited my cousin, Alan Wheeler, who was a student at Cambridge University at the time.  It was a great place to sleep off our jet lag, and then have a \""local\"" show us around for a couple of days.  A highlight was punting on the Cam.  I never knew until then that Cambridge was named for the bridge which crosses the Cam River there.

We chose not to make advance reservations for lodging, and were fortunate to be able to find reasonable rooms wherever we went.  We had overnight visits to York and Bath, especially enjoying the historical sites in those cities.  We then ventured north into Scotland, then on to Wales where we stayed in a medieval castle, but I will say more about those on the appropriate pages.  

A side trip to Stonehenge was a must see on our bucket list.  Then It was back to London to take in the sights of that City we had missed earlier.  It happened to be the same time as the queen mum\'s funeral, and also the London Marathon, so London was crowded with visitors.  Of the many sights we saw (Big Ben, Westminster Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, and much more), I was especially determined to see the Tower of London.  As fate would have it, we found ourselves standing on a  corner across from the Tower, and the street was blocked by the Marathon which was in progress.  We watched for an opening between the runners for several minutes, then finally made our dash across the closed street.  As we did, a policeman yelled at us to go back, saying \""These people have waiting all year for this race, you\'ll have to come back tomorrow.\""  I grabbed my wife\'s hand and kept running while I yelled back, \""I\'ve waited 54 years to see the Tower of London, and today is my only chance.\""  I don\'t know what the onlookers thought of us rude Americans, but we loved our visit to their awesome city.",260

From the train station, travelers walk a winding cobblestone path up through Karlstejn village to reach the castle, although there are often horse-drawn buggies waiting to take tourists up through the quaint little town.  The castle itself is well-preserved due to its location at the top of a craggy outcropping of rock which made it so well protected that in its 400+ year history, the castle was never taken.  There are some well-preserved original pieces of furniture dating back to the 17th century that were used by the castle inhabitants, including the painted panels from a dresser used by some of the castle knights.  This is a wonderful day-trip from Prague that lets you ride through the beautiful Czech countryside and get away from the crowds that gather on the Charles Bridge and in the Old Town every day.",257

1,23057,"Monday morning, we woke up and went to Bobis along the Riva Promenade for some pastries for breakfast. The storm the night before had cleared out and it was just beautiful along the riva. I was surprised to see all the beautiful palm trees along here.  After eating, we swung by a bank ATM to withdraw kuna and then headed to Diocletian's Palace.  As one of the top tourist attractions in Split, it was quite crowded.  Vendors were set up all along the pedestrian streets in the palace, but it was too crowded to really browse.  So we bought tickets to explore the basement areas.  We first walked around the western wing.  This ancient palace was really beautiful and it was just amazing to be walking around such an old structure.  Despite its age, the palace was in remarkably good shape and the supporting columns and structures were beautiful.  A number of old artifacts were laying about in the basement area, including old bowls, stone plaques, and sarcophagi.  A few 3500-year old sphinxes were found in this area, which the emperor had procured from Egypt.  Unfortunately, most were beheaded as later Christians considered them idols.  In a couple spots of the basement, parts of the palace had collapsed, but fortunately, restoration work is in progress.  We also found a bust of Diocletian himself, though I don't think that dated from his era.  After exploring this side for a while, we headed over to the east wing that had similar features but not as many rooms were open.  Here, we saw a couple of people dressed as Roman soldiers and followed them outside to where they had a short performance with the emperor himself coming out to address the crowd.  Out here in the courtyard was an intact sphinx from Egypt, one of the only that wasn't beheaded.  At one part of the courtyard, beautiful flowers were growing up the walls.  Exploring further around the palace, we headed through the vestibule and came across a jewelry shop where a lady was making glass jewelry.  It was interesting watching her work with the glass and I bought Sandy a pendant before we left.  Next, we headed to the cathedral to see some of the other sights.  Our first stop was the treasury that had a number of beautiful artifacts on display, but no photography was permitted.  The relics of Saint Domnius as well as beautiful chalices and and ornate crosses, paintings, and old manuscripts.   Next, we walked though the cathedral which was truly beautiful, inside and out.  There were several altars that were so elaborate.  This is one of the oldest Catholic cathedrals in the world still in its original structure.  From here, we headed up the bell tower.  Initially, we climbed up some very narrow and steep stone stairs up about half way and then climbed up metal stairs to the top.  It was crowded, but at each point we stopped, the views just kept getting better and better.  First, we ascended to the level of nearby rooftops, then a higher above the roofs and finally to the top with great 360-degree views of Split and the surrounding mountains.  We could see all the buildings with their orange roofs, Marjan hill in the distance and the gorgeous coastline.  A storm was brewing and it was fantastic watching the clouds roll in from here.  Looking down, I could see the open ceiling of the vestibule we had walked down earlier.  Heading back down the stairs, we descended into the crypt, which was the former mausoleum of Emperor Diocletian.  Finally, we swung by the Temple of Jupiter that had been converted into a baptistery dedicated to St. John.  The ceiling inside the temple was really ornate and beautiful.  As we left the temple, it started raining lightly and we were getting hungry so we got lunch nearby.  Seafood is very popular along the Dalmatian coast, but I'm not a big fan.  Fortunately, there’s a strong Italian influence so I was always able to find something I liked.  After a late lunch, we swung by the office for Portal Tours to pay for our tours for the week and get our vouchers.  Then we started walking towards Marjan Hill.  There were a lot of stairs and uphill through the old Veli Varoš district to Vidilica cafe.  The overlooks here provided great views of Split and the harbor down below, but this is only part of the way up the hill.  Trails and roads lead up the hill and it was a very pleasant hike.  Along the way, we saw lots of enormous aloe plants.  We also passed by the Church of St. Nicholas.  It was a small church and the door was locked so we couldn't go inside, but I put my camera through a hole to get a picture of the interior.  Continuing on, the trail came out at the site of a former zoo and then led up to the top of Marjan Hill where the Croatian flag was flying.  From up here, we had a great view of Split from above, but the view west towards the sunset was blocked.  So after a few pictures, we headed back down and had dinner and cocktails along the Riva.  The harbor was beautiful at night.  After dinner, we headed to bed as we had a long day planned for tomorrow.

Tuesday morning, we woke up early and grabbed some pastries from Bobis before heading to the bus stop for our tour to Plitvice Lakes.  It’s a long drive – 3 to 4 hours – so we had to start early.  Our tour guide was Mario and our driver was Tiho.  We absolutely loved them – our favorite guides of the week.  During the long drive, Mario kept us entertained by teaching us about Croatian history and culture and a few words in Croatian (though he wouldn’t teach us any bad words!).  Right away, we passed by the fortress of Klis, which is where Mereen in Game of Thrones is filmed.  As we headed deeper into hinterland, Mario pointed out how the trees and plantlife were stunted due to high winds coming off the sea.  We made a quick stop for snacks at a gas station near Maslenica where we could see the Velebit Mountains.  We would pass through this mountain shortly.  After our stop, we drove through Sveti Rok Tunnel, passing through the Velebit Mountains.  This was the longest tunnel in Croatia at nearly 6 km.   Through the tunnel, we left the Dalmatia region and entered Lika.  On this side of the mountain, protected from the strong winds by the mountains, the land was all forested.  Amazing what a difference the side of the mountain makes.  We continued for another hour or so, finally arriving at Plitvice Lakes National Park around 11 at entrance 2.  After Mario got our tickets, we entered the park and took a short boat ride across Lake Kozjak to begin our hike around the Upper Lakes.  Boardwalks wrap around the many lakes here, each separated by the most beautiful waterfalls.  The park was very crowded, despite being shoulder season, so walking around on the boardwalks was slow going.  We passed by a few smaller, presumably unnamed waterfalls, and soon arrived at the first named waterfall Veliki Prštavac, at 28 m high.  This is the second highest waterfall in the park.  It was a real beauty, but was flowing strongly and produced a lot of mist.  Continuing on, we then made it to Mali Prštavac, a similar waterfall at 18 m.  Next, we came to Galova&#269;ki Buk.  Although not particularly high, I thought this was the most beautiful waterfall in the park.  A dozen or more streams of water tumbled down from one lake to the next into the most beautiful turquoise pool of water.  This was such a beautiful scene and truly captured the stunning beauty of Plitvice Lakes.  Heading further up along the lakes, we saw many more small, unnamed waterfalls.  Arriving at essentially the top, we made a short restroom stop and waited a short time for the shuttle bus.  It was a bit chaotic getting on the bus - Mario advised me to use my tripod to whack other tourist and ensure our group go on the bus.  The shuttle took us all the way down to the past the upper lakes and parked at the lower lakes.  From here, we followed gravel road down to lake level.  Another trail, mostly composed of boardwalks led past the lower lakes.  We first passed Milanova&#269;ki Slap waterfall, which drained into a most beautiful lake.  The water here is so clear and green.  A number of fish, European Chub I believe, could be seen in the water.  Continuing on, we passed more small cascades and the beautiful turquoise water before heading to the big waterfall.  Veliki Slap is the highest waterfall in the park at 78 m.  Of course it was very crowded, but we climbed on some rocks to get some good pictures of this massive waterfall.  Then we started heading back towards entrance 1 where Tiho would pick us up.  Heading back up the gorge, we passed a couple more overlooks of Veliki Slap from a distance.  Although the lighting was poor, it was a great view of this waterfall and really put perspective on its massive size.  We could see not only the main drop that we could see from the base, but also additional cascades and drops downstream.  Back at the bus, we went a short ways to lunch at Vila Velebita.  It was a late lunch by around 4 when we arrived and we were all very hungry.  But the food was really delicious and nice to have something more traditionally Croatian.  After lunch, we started making the long drive back to Split.  On the way, Mario opened the bar so we could purchase beer or wine on the ride back.  I had a Velebitsko Temno.  Mario claimed it was the best beer in Europe, but having been in Munich for Oktoberfest, I was a bit skeptical.  But after tasting it, I agreed – it was great.  Unfortunately, I’m not sure I can get it back home.  Mario gave us some more information about Croatia’s history on the ride home and we made one more stop for a sunset view over Krka River.  As we approached Split, Mario handed us a note that Tiho was a good singer and we should ask him to sing us a song.  Tiho sang O Sole Mio for us as we drove through Split back to the bus stop.  It had been a long day so we headed back to the hotel after our tour and went to bed.

Wednesday morning we slept in a bit and then had breakfast out on the Riva.  Around 10, we headed to the South Gate of Diocletian’s Palace to get picked up for our canyoneering adventure.  Our shuttle took us over to the small town of Zadvarje and we had about a 20 minute break to use the restrooms and grab a snack.  Then we headed to the tour office for a safety briefing and to get our gear – wet suits for the cold water, a PFD, and a helmet.  Once we were all geared up, they drove us to the start of our adventure.  It was quite warm in the wet suits, so the cold water was a bit of a relief.  We hike down into the gorge and soon starting canyoneering down Cetina River.  The water was chilly but wearing a wet suit kept us warm enough.  Almost immediately we had to jump into a deep pool and then rock hop and wade further down.  There were several spots to jump into the water as well as a couple water slides to enjoy.  In slow-moving sections of the river, we just floated downstream.  About half way down the river, we stopped for a break on some big rocks and then got out of the water and headed into a narrow tunnel.  This river was used extensively for hydroelectric power generation and the there was evidence all around.  In fact, the tiny village of Zadvarje had power before Split thanks to the river's power.  We used this tunnel to get around Gubavica, a large waterfall on Cetina River.  Back at the river, we headed upstream a bit to the base of Gubavica.  There was a big rock here to climb up and jump into the deep pool at the base of the falls.  After a few jumps here, we continued downstream.  There were a few more rock hop and swimming sections and then we came to another spot where we had to climb a ridge to get around.  There were ropes to assist with the steep climb up and then back down, reminding me of some of the more difficult waterfall hikes back home.  Soon we came back to a rather flat section of the river near the end of our adventure.  We floated downstream a bit and passed a tall waterfall.  It comes from the overflow of the dam, so it’s not a real waterfall, but was really pretty nonetheless.  At this point, we got out of the water and followed a trail to once last wade across the river and then up to the road where the shuttles were waiting to bring us back.  We changed clothes and then headed back to Zadvarje and then were shuttled back to Split.  We took showers and then headed to dinner in the evening.  We stopped by a grocery store to pick up some wine and had drinks down by the Riva.

Thursday morning, we woke up early again and ate breakfast down at the Riva.  After breakfast, we headed to the bus stop for our tour of Krka National Park and &#348;ibenik.  Our tour guide today was Ernest and our driver was George.  Leaving Split, we first stopped at Trogir to pick up some additional folks.  This is Ernest’s home and he had lots to tell us about this little town.  We continued on away from the coast and into Krka National Park.  We first stopped at Skradinski Buk, Krka’s largest and most well-known waterfall.  This is the last waterfall on Krka River before it flows into the Adriatic Sea.  Our quick stop for a sunset view two days earlier was just a short ways downstream from this waterfall.  We started off near the top and made a clockwise loop on the trail around the waterfall.  The Church of St. Nicholas was near the start.  Skradinski Buk has a number of cascading sections, each one quite beautiful.  I don't there's anywhere to see the entire thing.  Although there were several old mills and other buildings around the falls, I didn’t they distracted much from the scene.  We slowly worked our way down after viewing each of the cascades and drops.  At the bottom, we crossed the footbridge over the river to the base at the pool below the falls.  Unlike Plitvice Lakes, swimming is permitted, and I had to take the opportunity to take a dip.  The water was quite cold and the current was surprisingly strong.  It was hard to stop for a picture without getting swept downstream.  I didn’t stay in long as it was too chilly, however.  After drying off, we started heading back up the other side.  It was more natural on this side with none of the mills or old buildings here.  We saw beautiful travertine cliffs as we were heading up.  There was another really scenic waterfall along the way on a small tributary of Krka River.  Soon we got to probably the best view spot of Skradinski Buk – perched up on a cliff, the waterfall, footbridge, and old buildings made a beautiful scene.  And yet, even here, we could only see a portion of the entire waterfall.  Continuing on, the boardwalk trails looped around past scenic little ponds and small drops, but nothing else too big.  There was one area with a huge number of wildflowers blooming.  Finishing up the loop, we made a quick stop at the old mill.  We then headed back to the bus to continue exploring the park.  Driving north, we made a quick stop to view the Visovak Island, containing a 14th monastery.  The island is not completely natural – the monks added rocks over the years to increase the size of the island.  The views here of the island, monastery, and Krka river were great.  After a couple pictures, we continued on to Roški Slap.  Here we had a traditional buffet lunch with bread, cheese, olives, and meat.  We even had some local sherry and wine.  After lunch we took some time to explore.  First, we hiked the rather steep Niz Plo&#269;u trail up to a great overlook of the Krka River.  Although steep and rocky, I stopped a couple times to enjoy the view and check out the chimney bellflower blooming along the trail.  In the distance, the river flowed between two mountains that almost looked like a wall that had been broken by the river.  Heading back down, we swung by the boat dock to see Roški Slap waterfall.  The view wasn’t ideal from here; I think the only way to get a good view of this waterfall would be from a boat.  We swung by the gift shop and picked up a couple little bottles of sherry to take home.  Then we got back in the bus and left the park en route to the historic town of &#348;ibenik.  We stopped near the docks and followed Ernest toward the town square and the Cathedral of St. James, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Ernest provided some history of this beautiful church, pointing out some of the beautiful architectural features.  The building was unfortunately damaged in the war, but was being restored.  We then took a quick walk through the inside of the cathedral to see the beautiful altar and interior.  Outside, I got a picture of many of the stone heads on the side of the building.  Then we headed up to the Medieval Garden of St. Lawrence Monastery.  It's a very small garden, but quite scenic right in the old town of &#348;ibenik.  Firethorn and other pretty flowers were blooming in the garden and a small cafe provided a spot to get a drink and relax.  After a few minutes, we headed back to the bus to head back to Split.  It was a lovely drive along the coast between &#348;ibenik and Split as we made out way back.

Friday was an early morning as we had a long day heading to Dubrovnik.  Our tour guide today was Igor and our driver was Ivan.  After everyone was boarded on the bus, we headed south.  We made a bathroom and snack break at the highest gas station in Croatia where we could see the towering Biokovo Mountains, the second highest mountain range in Croatia.  From here, we continued south to our first stop in the small town of Ston.  A defensive stone wall was built around the town that looked like a miniature version of China’s Great Wall.  In town, Igor pointed out a couple places to stop.  First we hit up a bakery to pick up some pastries and meat pies to eat.  Then we swung by the wine store to get some Croatian wine to bring home before exploring the small town.  Walking south out of the walls, we could see the salt pans.  We didn't really have enough time to walk through so just got some pictures from the street.  Down one street, we could see the Church of St. Blaise.  Originally built in around 1340, the church has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes, most recently in 1996.  And like many times in the preceding centuries, the church was being restored.   We walked around the town a bit more along the walls and spotted some amazing cactus growing up along the city walls.  But then it was time, so we headed back to the bus and continue towards Dubrovnik.  Continuing on, we passed through a small section of Bosnia-Herzegovina and then back into Croatia.  The drive along the coast here was absolutely beautiful and soon we were headed into Dubrovnik.  Dubrovnik is always crowded and a couple cruise ships were in port, so it was even more crowded than usual, despite being shoulder season.  We got dropped off at the bus stop near an interesting fountain with statues of Pan and Nymph.  Starting our exploration of the city, Igor took us around the old town of the city for about an hour.  He provided some fascinating history of the city and pointed out several landmarks throughout the city, including the the stairs where Cersei Lannister did her Walk of Atonement in Game of Thrones.  Dubrovnik is the setting for Kings Landing and we recognized many spots from the show.  He also showed us many of the beautiful churches located in the city.  The Dubrovnik Cathedral was one of the most beautiful.  When Igor was finished, we had some free time to explore the city and headed up to the famous city walls.  Starting out in the eastern end of the walls near the harbor, we headed up and walked around the walls in the counterclockwise direction.  Up here, we had amazing views of the city.  The walls span the perimeter of the city and we spent about an hour and a half walking around.  There were several old cannons up here, indicating the defensive nature of these walls.  The bright orange roofs of the buildings of Dubrovnik made a spectacular sight from the walls.  About halfway through, we stopped at Min&#269;eta Tower.  Climbing up to the top was the highest point on the walls and provided the best views.  Continuing on, we could see Lovrijenac Fort, which is detached from the old town.  Standing tall on a cliff high above the sea, this old fortress was stunningly beautiful.  The last section of the walls was along the coast and we could see the rocky water far below.  At one point high above the rugged rocky coast, we watched some people jump into the ocean from the cliffs.  When we finished the walls, we headed back to the old town.  We visited the Church of St. Ignatius with the most beautiful interior.  The ceiling above the altar was painted with a heavenly scene and reminded me of the Sistine Chapel.  Then we continued through town to Lovrijenac Fort, just outside the old town.  There were many stairs to climb up but the views of the Old Town were great from here.  It really put into perspective the scope of the city walls we had walked earlier.  After some pictures, it was getting to be about time so we headed back, passing the West Harbor of Dubrovnik.  Returning to the bus, we made the long drive home but Igor told us some stories and history of Croatia to pass the time.

Saturday was our last full day in Croatia and today we were doing a boat tour of the many islands off the coast of Split.  We boarded the speedboat at 830 with our guide Martko.  We first stopped at &#268;iovo island near Trogir to pick up some other visitors and then made the rather long boat ride to the island of Biševo to see the Blue Cave.  The Blue Cave is illuminated from around 11 to 12 so we had to go here first to see the cave under optimal lighting conditions.  The boat was cruising at about 25 MPH so it got a little chilly with the wind.  In about 2 hours, we made it to Biševo and had a quick break.  The views here of Vis in the distance were really nice.  We then boarded a smaller boat to head to the cave.  The Blue Cave has a very small entrance and so larger boats can’t get in.  Even in the small boat, we had to duck down when entering.  Inside the cave, sunlight penetrated the water outside the cave and illuminated the cave in a beautiful blue light.  It was amazing to see and hard to believe that it’s natural lighting.  After a quick run through the cave, we returned to the dock and re-boarded our tour boat.  Martko took us over to the fishing village of Komiža on the island of Vis.  We had about an hour here, so we walked around the town, first visiting Komuna, the fishing museum.  They had some interesting exhibits but the highlight was the view from the top.  Then we stopped by Gusarica beach and relaxed for a bit to enjoy the view of the bay.  Back at the boat, we continued around Vis and made a quick stop at Stiniva beach, rated as the best in Europe.  Tucked back away in cove protected by cliffs, it's no wonder it was rated highly.  Our next stop was at the Green Cave on the island of Ravnik.  This cave is much larger than Blue Cave and bigger boats were able to get in.  A small hole in the roof of the cave allowed sunlight to get in, creating an interesting green spot in the water.  A few people were in the water swimming, but with multiple boats in here, swimming didn't seem safe.  As we were leaving the cave, we saw some people on top of the cave, jumping into the water.  It was getting into the afternoon and we were getting hungry so our next stop was the small island Budikovac, with a population of one.  A rather eccentric gentleman lives here year round with his donkeys and some other livestock.  We had lunch here and then took some time to swim and snorkel in the beautiful water.  The water was very cold, but so crystal clear and I spotted a few fish while snorkeling.  It was too cold to stay in long.  Our last stop was the city of Hvar on the island of the same name.  We first walked past the Church of St. Stephen and then made the hike up to the fortress.  Along the way, we passed an old church; I never figured out a name for this one.  At the fortress, we first headed down into the prison.  There were several small cells, including a torture chamber.  Then we went up to the top of the fortress for amazing views overlooking Hvar and the harbor.  After a few pictures, we headed back into town just walked around the beautiful old city for a bit.  Passing the Benedictine Monastery, there was a statue of a monk praying outside.  When it was time, we got back on the boat and headed back to Split.  There was some type of regatta going on and we passed a number of sailboats as we headed back to Split.  For our last dinner in Split, we ate at Fife.  It was buffet style, but the food was really good.  After that, we had one more drink along the Riva to enjoy sunset and then headed back to the room to pack.  Sunday was long day in many airports, but we made it home without any incidents.",254

It was the last leg of a two week trip to the old Soviet Union.  I was frustrated to be in Frankfurt for three hours but not to be able to see anything except the airport and the area right around it.

0,14937,"My ship, the MV Houston, brought containerized supplies to Ascension Island in August 2014. We loaded the containers in Port Canaveral, Florida. The majority of the containers were from Patrick AFB nearby in Florida. The goods were mostly supplies for the US Air Force base on the island (items for their commissary and exchange, as well as individuals\' personal effects). There were some commercial containers as well.
   Ascension Island doesn\'t have a dock for cargo or ocean going ships. We anchored a mile or so off of Georgetown and motorized barges came alongside during daylight hours and our ship\'s cranes discharged two containers onto each barge. Ascension Island had experienced a large storm right before we arrived so there was a large ocean swell that made the discharge more challenging and dangerous.
   After receiving its quota of 2 boxes the barge would go to the shore where a shore-based crane would lift the boxes off the barge and put them on a truck to bring them to their destination. Later after the containers were emptied of their contents they were brought back to the ship for return to the US.",221
16,35,"My wife and I honeymooned in French Polynesia in May and June of 2004. After enjoying the islands of Bora Bora and Moorea in the Society Islands, we flew over to Rangiroa in the Tuamotus for a few days. Rangiroa was spectacular! We stayed at the Kia Ora which was expensive, but worth the splurge for a honeymoon. If you visit Rangiroa, the two things that you must do is visit the Blue Lagoon and shoot the pass via a drift snorkel. The Blue Lagoon is a smaller lagoon enclosed within Rangiroa&apos;s larger lagoon. I often refer to my trip to the Blue Lagoon as the best day of my life. The weather could not have been more beautiful. Our two Polynesian guides could not have been nicer and the scenery could not have been more impressive. The Blue Lagoon is the epitome of paradise!!! Its shallow waters were swarming with small black-tipped sharks that I fed fish guts to. You could swim from one little motu (island) to the next through crystal clear waters. Our guides prepared us (and the only other couple who accompanied us on our trip) a scruptious beach BBQ which included some of the best fish and potato salad I have ever tasted. On our trip back to the Kia Ora across Rangiroa&apos;s huge lagoon, we spotted a manta ray and a tiger shark. We also went for a snorkel at a little island smack dab in the middle of Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon where we were treated to some sea turtles. The next day, we shot the pass (we drift snorkeled through one of the two passes that connect Rangiroa&apos;s lagoon to the ocean). The current is so strong that you don&apos;t even need to swim. . .you are just carried by the current into the lagoon. It was by far the best snorkel of my life. Visibility was probably at 200 feet plus. The bottom of the pass had somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 large grey sharks (that was the approximate count made by our guide). Towards the end of our snorkel, we passed over a plateau where the ocean floor came within 10 meters of us. Never in my life had I witnessed so many colors all in one place. There were thousands upon thousands of fish of all diffferent sizes and shades. My wife and I were blown away by what we were looking at! Rangiroa was one of the highlights of all my travels and I hope that one day, I&apos;ll have the chance to visit it again and also visit some of its Tuamotu neighbors including Fakarava and Manihi. </p>",75
12,35,"My wife and I vistited the BVI during a two week trip through the Caribbean.  We stayed in Tortola for 3 nights and using that as our base traveled to St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to Virgin Gorda.  In my opinion, Virgin Gorda is the most beautiful island in the BVI, but I haven&apos;t been to Anageda or Jost Van Dyke, so my opinion might change one day after visiting those two islands.  While on Virgin Gorda, we explored the world-famous Baths; large rock out-croppings on Virgin Gorda&apos;s south shore that look somewhat similar to the granite rocks you see on some Seychelles&apos; beaches.  We also rented our own little schooner to explore Virgin Gorda&apos;s gorgeous, multi-colored North Sound.  The North Sound is dotted with picture-perfect islands and coral reefs.  Two islands that we stopped on were Saba Rock (not to be confused with Saba in the Netherlands Antilles) to grab a bite to eat and Eustatia Island (also not to be confused with St. Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles) to swim in it&apos;s warm off-shore waters.  Our time in paradise was unfortunately dampered by me losing my wedding ring while hopping in and out of our schooner in the North Sound and then several days later when I left our camera on our LIAT flight down to Grenada.  While I was able to replace my wedding ring, I lost forever my pictures of the British Virgin Islands. . . I guess I&apos;ll have to go back one day to take some more pictures!",220

Of special interest was the row of colorful waterfront buildings which provides an iconic travel photo opportunity at Willemstad, the capital and largest city of the island.  Not to be missed in Willemstad is the preserved historic RIF Fort, established in 1828.

 We also took a tour around the island and found the interior equally fascinating for it\\\\\\\'s history, beaches, and quaint countryside  there were everal points of interest, including a natural arch, salt flats, and the beautiful beach at Playa Kenepa Grandi.

6,1,"Rockall is probably the most difficult island to land on in the world, due to its sheer sides and the rough surrounding North Atlantic seas, which create huge swells even in calm conditions. In 2005, I sailed with British TV personality Ben Fogle from Mallaig, Scotland, on the Eda Frandsen (<a href=""http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/"">http://www.eda-frandsen.co.uk/)</a> to attempt to land on Rockall, but we turned back in the middle of the night 50 nautical miles away, in the midst of a worsening gale. We spent 2 very nice days at St. Kilda and cruising the Outer Hebrides, but did not approach Rockall. Ben dropped me off at the dock in the tiny outer Hebrides settlement of Leverburgh, and eventually was able to sail back to Rockall the following week, but was unable to land. Ben writes about this adventure in his book &quot;Offshore&quot; (<a href=""http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore"">http://www.benfogle.com/books/offshore).</a></p><p>In 2008, I joined &quot;Island Man&quot; Andy Strangeway, 7 other passengers, and 3 crew in Leverburgh to board the Elinca (<a href=""http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/"">http://www.beyondthebluehorizon.co.uk/</a>), skippered by Angus Smith . Conditions were ideal for the voyage out; in fact, we had to motor due to lack of wind! Nevertheless, swells at Rockall ranged from 15-20 feet, making approach to the side of the island by dinghy impossible. After waiting all day in vain for the swells to subside, Angus sent out his son Innis with a kayak to investigate more closely. Videographer and erstwhile surf instructor Mark Lumsden accompanied Innis with a surfboard.</p><p>Mark astonished us all by bodysurfing the swell towards the rock, then grasping the skirt of kelp, and hauling himself up into a crag in the rock face. Having thus proven the possibility of landing, he climbed to the top and back down, then returned to the ship and gave me his wetsuit to follow. It was difficult, but I landed on the rock! Four other passengers were able to land this way (in sequence, using the same wetsuit) and two of the others were also able to scramble to the top of the rock.</p><p>Unfortunately, Andy Strangeway, the organizer, was unable to land in 2008, but the upside for MTP members is that he will organize another attempt in 2009 (<a href=""http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/"">http://islandmanrockallexpedition2009.com/</a>).</p>",569

We stayed in at the Hotel Settembre 95, a small boutique hotel located within a reasonable walk to many of the sites in Rome.  And walk we did.  While we saw much, we feel like we didn't even scratch the surface.  We could have spent weeks and still not take it all in.  Each day, we centered our explorations around a particular area.  One day we did historic Rome and Palantine Hill, on another, the Vatican area, on another the downtown, and on the last day we ventured outside Rome down the old Appian way. <br>Our first day, we spent time exploring the historical ancient Rome.  Surrounded by such antiquity and beauty, we allowed ourselves to get lost in the life of the ancient Etruscans and Romans.  Visiting such sites as the Coliseum, Palantine Hill, the Forum, and countless temples, statues, arches and monuments, we learned much about the history of this fascinating city.  The Michelin Green guide was an invaluable tool for us and for anyone who travels and is interested in the history and culture of an area.<br>The next day, we took the bus across the river to the land of the ""Holy See"", but I will cover that in that report.<br>The third day, was reserved for visiting the more modern center of the city and for shopping.  Wandering the Via Veneto, Quirinale, Castro Pretorio, Repubblica, and Trevi neighborhoods we visited an outdoor Christmas market at Piazza Navona along with many shops and small churches..  We bought some Christmas presents as well as ogled over all of the expensive designer items available in such abundance.  We also found time to just sit and relax, at a sidewalk cafe, as well as on the famous Spanish Steps, talking, and watching the throngs of interesting people pass us by.<br>On our final day we decided to venture outside the city, taking a bus and visiting the ancient Christian Catacombs and the old aqueduct along the Via Appia Antica (the Appian Way).  A very interesting and worthwhile trip.  Not only did we learn alot about ancient Christian history, but also enjoyed a nice jaunt down a very historical road.<br>Oh yes, one more thing.  We made sure to throw a coin over our shoulder into Trevi Fountain.  That way, according to legend, we will be assured that we will be returning to this magical city.<br>",891

0,1,"The Chesterfield Islands are a remote island group nearly halfway between New Caledonia and Australia.  For a few years, I searched for a way to cross between the two, in order to visit Mellish Reef and Chesterfields on the same run but it was too expensive and logistically challenging, due to distance, fuel, and customs requirements.  Finally, I agreed to charter a sportfishing boat, the Quo Vadis, through Pacific Charters in Noumea.<br><br>Quo Vadis is skippered by Olivier Quach, an interesting and accomplished Caledonian of Vietnamese descent.  Direct booking can be made through their family business Powercat Charter (www.powercat-charter.com).  Olivier's brother Gerald is a bodybuilder who was previously ""Mister New Caledonia"", and his friend Michel was a Pacific spearfishing champion.<br><br>We departed Koumac on the northern tip of the mainland the night of 11 December, 2004, and were among the Chesterfields 36 hours later.  Along the way we caught a swordfish, mahi mahi, and a parrotfish, as well as lobster in the lagoon (there was one other fishing boat in the lagoon while we were there).<br><br>We landed on Ile du Loop - the southernmost of the Chesterfields, which we knew to have a marker suitable for a photo, but just in case, the Quach brothers had created a handmade sign reading ""Welcome to Chesterfields"".  Ile du Loop was absolutely covered with red-footed boobys, and it was here that I realized the derivation of ""booby-trap"".  Boobies dig nests in the sandy scrub, then camouflage the holes with brush, creating a dangerous zone for walking, with the potential for broken legs at every step!<br><br>After a fabulous sashimi and lobster dinner, we set out for Noumea at sunset, arriving 36 hours later to catch high tide through the passage into Koumac.  A highlight of the subsequent week in Noumea was dinner at Chez Quach 3 nights later.  Many Vietnamese spring rolls and much American whiskey was consumed that night to celebrate our successful Chesterfields expedition.",8

9,35,"The Society Islands are 1 of 5 island groups that make up French Polynesia and home to its capital, Papetee on the island of Tahiti.  As a child, I dreamed of visiting Bora Bora, which I would regularly hear dubbed on tv programs as the ""Most Beautiful Island in the World.""  My wife and I, therefore, decided to honeymoon in French Polynesia in May/June 2004.  We started in Bora Bora, then hopped over to Moorea before ending our romantic island adventures on Rangiroa in the Tuamotus.  Although Bora Bora is a very popular tourist destination these days, it is still drop-dead gorgeous.  Because it was our honeyomoon, we decided to splurge and stay in an overwater bungalow at the Pearl Resort.  All I can say is ""WOW!""  It doesn&apos;t get any better than having your own sun deck hanging off your hotel room with a ladder down into a crystal clear lagoon.  You could even feed the tropical fish that swam beneath your bungalow by removing the glass off of your coffee table.  Days were spent snorkeling in Bora Bora&apos;s warm translucent waters, paddling by canoe to one of Bora Bora&apos;s many motus, feeding ferocious sharks, or just taking in the scenery from the deck of our bungalow.  Nights were spent feasting on fresh seafood, including poisson cru (raw tuna in coconut milk and lime juice), and lying underneath the Tahitian moon again from the deck of our bungalow.  We even had a breakfast of fresh tropical fruits and croissants canoed right up to our bungalow one morning!  After Bora Bora, it was on to Moorea.  Although Moorea does not have nearly as beautiful of a lagoon as Bora Bora, it does have towering jungle-covered peaks.  We circumnavigated the entire island of Moorea by car one day and nearly biked around half of the island another day.  Shark feeding was especially spectacular on Moorea.  To make our connection from Moorea to Rangiroa, we had to fly back to Tahiti.  One thing that I always like to tell people about my 8 minute flight from Moorea to Tahiti is that we landed at our destination before we were even scheduled to take off!  It&apos;s true and pretty weird when you say it like that, but because all the passengers had checked in about 30 minutes before our scheduled take-off, they decided to board us and take off early, thus allowing us to arrive before our scheduled departure!",66

Someday I would like to go back, the city is well known for its lace and there are many shops selling it. We had lunch at a beer garden restaurant and the food was excellent. We also went to visit Gent and this was another great city to walk around in. The Gravensteen castle was one of places we visited then we ate at another beer garden restaurant at Groentenmarkt 9.

5,3533,"Tromelin is the smallest of the 4 Scattered Islands I visited.  It is anoval shaped island about 1600 meters (one mile) long and 700 meters(less than half a mile) wide.  It is covered by many low attrative bushesthat the boobies like to nest in.  At the highest end - only 7 meters -is a weather station, a substantial concrete building designed towithstand cyclones which typically hit the island every 3 years.  Thereare 40 or 50 coconut trees around the weather station.  These are theonly trees on the island.There were 6 or 7 people living here: a few weathermen and a fewnaturalists studying birds and turtles.  Unlike the other scattered French islands in the Indian Ocean there is no military presence.The other major features of the island is that it is shaped like asaucer with a depression in the middle so you have an unobstructed viewacross the island as you walk the path that circumnavigates it.  Thelanding strip fits perfectly lengthwise on the island.Finally, there is no reef or lagoon so the waves come crashing into theisland.  It is dangerous to swim because sharks can come almost to theshore.  Basically, the island is a coral reef above the ocean so all yousee is coral and some sand.  Half of the beach is rocky.The main attraction on the island are 2 species of boobies: thered-footed boobie and the masked boobie.  They are fairly comfortablewith people so you can come within 10 meters.  There are some otherbirds as well.The total number of turtle tracks is about 4,000 a year and the peak dayis about 20.  This was surprising to me because of limited sand beaches.In contrast, the Glorioso Islands have superb sand beachs for turtles.Since a female turtle can lay eggs every 12 days for 3 to 7 times.  Thismeans that less than 1000 turtles a year visit Tromlein.The French eradicated the rats in 2005, but there are still some mice.At the weather station there are hundreds and hundreds of hermit crabs.Frequently, one crab will do a take down move on another crab thatusually defends itself successfully for the 5 minutes of the attack, butit can end in canabalism.In the Wikipedia article on Tromelin, one can read the story of theshipwreched slaves in 1761.  We viewed the anchor of the ship at lowtide and 5 of the cannons are still on the beach after all these years!!The journalists on board waded into the ocean to see the other 8 cannonsjust 4 meters off the beach.All of the tourists enjoyed our one day stay on Tromelin and boarded thehelicopter at the end of the day in our usual fashion to return to the Marion Dufresne.Since there is no Gendarme on the island, the ships doctor stamped all ofour passports.",469

This city was very nice which had a lot of character and beautiful old buildings. We like to stay in these uncommon cities that most tourists stay away from. At the hotel we had a very large suite with a large balcony, which gave us plenty of room. We went to the SPA to get massages and it was one of the worst massages I ever had.

I had a Hertz rental car that I picked up in Zagreb with a final drop off in Dubrovnik. We spent one night in Zadar at a ladys home were she rented rooms, then continued the next day to Split. Now Split is crowded and congested with tourist, either taking the ferries or trying to enjoy the seafront. Since it was congested here we did not want to spend the night here. We drove south and found a more tranquil area along the coast with very few tourist and spent the night at Jurcevic pension in Mimce. This drive down the coast reminded me of the California coast. We dropped off our rental car on the hilly city of Dubrovnik after we found a room for rent at a private house walking distance to the old city.

The weather was very cold so I had to purchase a pull over jacket to stay warm. I visited the state museum of Auschwitz and Birkenau, while walking around the compound I could just imagine how cruel the conditions must have been. Here I was trying to keep warm all bundled up and the prisoners must of froze to death with probably nothing to keep them warm. There were just a handful of tourists walking the area since the weather was so cold and dreary. The next day I went to the Wieliczka salt mines, the place was amazing and huge.

After dropping off our daughter in Leeds for the 100th anniversary celebration of the Girl Guides we drove north to Scotland. I booked two nights at the Radisson Blu hotel. Edinburgh was a delite, we loved this city and all that it had to offer. One disappointing fact facing Edinburgh is all the tourist trap souvenir shops that are everywhere. I like buying postcards but the souvenir shops here were overwhelming. We took a local bus to go see Rosslyn Chapel which is nearby in the village of Roslin. We arrived just before closing but were able to see the interior, the outside had scaffolding. Our next stop was to the north in Inverness, a lot of tourists come here to either go to Loch Ness or the Orkney Islands. I booked two nights at the Ramada Encore hotel a one minute walk to the bus station. I didnt think this area received a lot of tourists but our hotel was packed. Inverness is small so everything was walking distance from our hotel. We had booked a day tour to Orkney Island and our tour started at the bus station. We also visited Glasgow and also enjoyed this city. Our goal for being in Glasgow was to stop in Lockerbie to see the memorial for the Pan Am Airlines terrorist attack on 21DEC88. We continued our drive south and drove into Cardiff Wales. ",312
52,6671,"We had departed from Bucharest Romania by train to Varna. The train ride took 8 hours, but no water or food is offered on the train. It was the worst train ride in my experiences as the train had no air conditioning either. The various train station stops did not have water or food sold by vendors either. Finally after that very hot train ride we arrived in Varna. I stayed at my coworkers flat in Varna for three nights which is located next to Primorski Park and the beach. While in Varna we visited the Roman Thermae bath ruins, Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin, and St Nikolai church. The Varna tourist office offers free walking tours of the city, which I took advantage of and its well worth it. We also went on a day trip by bus to visit nearby UNESCO Nesebar. The bus takes about two hours and its well worth the time to get there. We departed Varna on a comfortable overnight bus to Istanbul Turkey.",247
207,6671,"We hired a taxi driver from Tangier to take us to the Ceuta border it costed us 300 dirhams. I paid a hustler 3 dirhams for 3 passport forms, you can get them free at the passport window. The customs agent stamped our passports and we walked through to the Spanish side. Passing the border was not difficult and pretty easy compared to what guidebooks might show. We took a taxi to our hotel which was the Tryp Ceuta. The hotel is in a convenient location and its easy to navigate the city streets. We went to have ice cream at the only McDonalds in town, it looks like an old fort. After traveling through Morocco for seven days it was a joy staying in this very clean and hussle free enclave. I enjoyed my morning espresso at La Alhambra cafe and our evening drinks at El Angulo bar restaurant inside the royal walls. This bar restaurant was very popular at night for its unique setting inside the fort. Most MTP members seem to just visit this enclave for a few hours and move on. We were glad we spent at least one night here since it was a very nice and tranquil place to be in, locals were always in a happy mood. At a travel agency we booked Acciona ferry to Algeciras Spain where we would continue our vacation. When entering the ferry the customs agents asked us where we were from, I told them Los Angeles. Both were surprised that we would come so far and stated that Californians are very rare in this area.",366
22,35,"We hopped on over to Sao Miguel from Lisbon for a few days in October 2005, which proved to not be enough time to thoroughly enjoy these mid-Atlantic jewels. The island of Sao Miguel was like a fairytale (rolling hills of green farmlands, roads lined with thousands of blue hydrangeas, perfectly manicured public gardens, amazingly blue and green volcanic lakes, and bubbling geysers). Plus, the Azores make some of the best cheese I&apos;ve ever tasted often accompanied with this spicy red chili sauce. Our brief trip to Sao Miguel has inspired us to one day go back and visit the other 8 islands that make up the Azores. The good news for us North Americans is that there are regular flights from Boston these days, so a trip all the way to Portugal is no longer necessary. </p>",222
116,6671,"We picked up our Hertz rental car in Algeciras and drove to the border of Gibraltar. I wanted to spend the night here but the British pound makes everything double the price. We parked the car at a lot across from the border and walked in. I asked the customs agent for a stamp in my passport and they stated I will get it on the way out. We bought a roundtrip bus ticket to take us to the main plaza area. While waiting for the bus to leave we saw a British Airways flight take off from the blocked road which doubles as the runway. Once we arrived at the end of the bus route we were amazed to see so many tourists here. I never knew this place was this popular, so many people at the border, the plaza, and everywhere else. We ate lunch at an Indian restaurant called Maharaja on Tuckeys Lane, the food was as good as you get it in London. We decided to walk over to the cable car that takes you to the top of the rock. It was well worth the price to the top, splendid views for great photos. You can see Morocco from this vantage point. The monkeys are very used to people and will walk very close to you. If you have a chance to spend the night it would be well worth it to stay in this lively enclave. We walked back across the border and I asked for the passport stamp, and they told me I get it on the way in. <br>With all the foot traffic I don\'t think the border agents want to be bothered. We walked back into Andalusia and continued our vacation through Spain.",269
92,6671,"We returned back into Italy with our rental car from Nice France and headed toward Seborga. After a brief visit in Seborga we continued to La Spezia to spend one night. We stayed at the Jolly hotel and went to dinner at another pasta and pizza restaurant in La Spezia. This is what we ate every night for dinner never getting tired of it. The next morning we drove to Manarola Cinque Terre a UNESCO world heritage site. There are five villages but we only had time to visit one of them. Hiking from village to village is a very popular thing to do here. You can arrive in Cinque Terre either by car, small bus, train or ferry. Our next stop was Pisa and Florence in Tuscany. ",900
85,6671,"We took the long southeast route from Florence Tuscany to San Marino. Along the way we stopped in Perugia where American Amanda Knox was recently on trial for murdering an English student. This is a very nice city, the old part sits on top of the hill. If we knew ahead of time how nice it was we would of spent the night here. Its unfortunate alot of character cities get overlooked by all the other popular destinations. We were low on euros and I attempted to get money at the bank and atm machines here with no luck. Since we had no money we continued to Assisi to have lunch and get some money. We ate at the entrance to the old city and I was able to get some euros from a banks atm. I have never had so much trouble with getting funds. We continued our drive through Marche then San Marino. ",907
7,2701,"Well, they say Iceland is green and Greenland is icy, and I can tell you that, that statement is true. Its summer here and I never saw anything green here, no grass, no trees, no weeds, just no green. I arrived to Nuuk which is the Capital of Greenland on a small plane, the airport was between two mountains and water on one side, once the plane landed you walked a minute to the building and a minute later you had your bag, there was no customs or immigration officers, no bank, no duty free, nothing and then it was 10 seconds and I was out of the building on my way, I was told that the town was a five minute bus ride away but I did not have any of the local currency but as usual I started to look for a ride and after asking the first person for directions he offered to give me a lift. There is about 16,000 people in the capital, so that guy who gave me the ride, I would see him later on the same day and a few more times before I left, and that’s how small it was. The Greenlandic people were very friendly and are similar looking to Eskimo’s from Alaska the other type of people that are there are Danish people since Greenland is a Danish territory, it felt like I went back in time, about 50 years. There was only 1 hotel in the whole town, 1 bank, 2 supermarkets were lots of the locals would hang out between them trying to sell their belongings on the side walk, no fast food chains at all, 2 traffic lights, no internet café’s, they just finished building the culture center so they showed films there, the police head quarters was in the same structure as the parliament building, at the only fish market they sold seals, I liked it, a new place to explore. No one in Greenland can own land so if some one had a house they had no front or back yard; there were also many ghetto style block buildings five floors high in the center of town, but yet the town as a whole was colorful, the roads were bad and it was quite dirty but great views of mountains every where, great scenery of the beautiful Nuuk fiord which is one of the largest fiords in Greenland, where you could see wild seals and icebergs floating by and the whole town was surrounded by water. Like Iceland it was never dark here, I think sunset was around midnight and 30 minutes later it was sunrise. I would say I was there about four hours when I was invited to some ones house for tea the host wanted to practice his English on me, he said he did not speak English for eight years or so, it was a big deal for his family to have me visit their home, they lived in those blocked buildings, there I tried some dried aged Polar bear meat. I could live with out it. Even thou the surroundings looked poor and Greenland is considered a third world country, lots of people were out of work and there is here a bit of a local drinking problem the prices were similar to Iceland, unbelievable. I had a few contacts here before arriving here, so I quickly got in touch with them and made some new friends here. We would hang out together; walk around together, party together, and go boating together;I really just had a peaceful good time here, spending time with them. After that I was staying in some ones home out in no mans land just enjoying the simple life, of walking around and climbing mountains and enjoying the nature. No stress and no schedule.",229
89,6671,"When we departed from Monte Carlo Monaco I made sure to stop and visit Seborga near the coast of San Remo. Its a very windy road to arrive at the top of the small village. We walked around the sleepy village and took some photos and went into a restaurant which was crowded with customers enjoying their lunch. I bought some souvenirs at the only shop in town from the grumpy lady that works there. She was upset that sales were very slow, but she doesnt understand that not that many people know about this place. When we were leaving a group of tourists were arriving, so maybe that will make her happy. After our brief visit we continued our drive to La Spezia to visit Cinque Terre. ",748
59,6671,"While driving from Provence Alpes Cote d Azur we wanted to see the Pont du Gard. We arrived in the late afternoon and no one was around this UNESCO site, we were the only people there. It was like a ghost town so we walked over to the aquaduct and took some pictures. There are signs stating that you cannot walk on it, in the past people were allowed to walk on its narrow path at the top. After our brief visit we drove into Auvergne.",854
204,6671,"While everyone slept in the rental car I drove from Extremadura and sneeked into Toledo. We were not supposed to stop here but I remember that this was a very unique and beautiful city on the hill. After entering we stopped in a cafe to enjoy some tapas and some rare Pepsi in a bottle. This was to be a quick visit so we only took pictures of the cathedral and alcazar. After this visit we continued north to Madrid.  <br><br>DEC1999<br>We drove from Segovia to Toledo and spent the night at Hotel Residencia Imperio on one of the cities tiny streets. Luckily I had rented a small Renault Clio which made it easy to find a parking space. The main place to visit was the Alcazar which was nicely restored. On our drive south we stopped in Consuegra to take pictures next to the windmills, like those described in Cervantess Don Quixote. The further south we drove the nicer the Spaniards were.",838
0,12953,"While staying with friends near Stuttgart I got up very early in the morning and drove about 90 minutes down to Büsingen, and then back, returning in time for a late breakfast. It was not as easy to  find as I had expected, but the beautiful countryside I drove through was well worth the extra effort. It was interesting to cross an international border four times within a fifteen minute period ... Germany 1 Switzerland 2 Germany 3 Switzerland 4 Germany.",248
183,6671,While we were in Berlin we drove to Potsdam in our rental car. The main attraction here is Sanssouci a residence built by King Frederick the Great in 1744. After our half day visit here we went back to Berlin.,806
